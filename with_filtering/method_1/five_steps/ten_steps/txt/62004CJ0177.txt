Declares that, by continuing to regard the supplier of a defective product as liable on the same basis as the producer where
            the producer cannot be identified, even though the supplier has informed the injured person within a reasonable time of the
            identity of the person who supplied him with the product, the French Republic has failed to take the necessary measures to
            comply fully with the judgment in Case C‑52/00 Commission v France as regards the transposition of Article 3(3) of Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the
            laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products, and has
            thereby failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 228 EC;
Orders the French Republic to pay to the Commission of the European Communities, into the ‘European Community own resources’
            account, a penalty payment of EUR 31 650 for each day of delay in taking the necessary measures to comply fully with the judgment
            in Case C‑52/00 Commission v France from delivery of the present judgment until full compliance with the judgment in that case;
Orders the French Republic to pay the costs.
