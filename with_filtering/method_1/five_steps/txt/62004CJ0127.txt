Article 11 of Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative
            provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products, is to be interpreted as meaning that a product
            is put into circulation when it is taken out of the manufacturing process operated by the producer and enters a marketing
            process in the form in which it is offered to the public in order to be used or consumed.
When an action is brought against a company mistakenly considered to be the producer of a product whereas, in reality, it
            was manufactured by another company, it is as a rule for national law to determine the conditions in accordance with which
            one party may be substituted for another in the context of such an action. A national court examining the conditions governing
            such a substitution must, however, ensure that due regard is had to the personal scope of Directive 85/374, as established
            by Articles 1 and 3 thereof.
