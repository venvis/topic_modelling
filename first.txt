ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT  HEREBY :    ( 1 ) DECLARES THAT , BY PROHIBITING THE RETAIL SALE OF CERTAIN GOODS IMPORTED FROM OTHER MEMBER STATES UNLESS THEY ARE MARKED WITH OR ACCOMPANIED BY AN INDICATION OF ORIGIN , THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS FAILED TO FULFIL AN OBLIGATION INCUMBENT ON IT UNDER ARTICLE 30 OF THE EEC TREATY .

ON THOSE GROUNDS,  THE COURT  HEREBY :  ( 1 ) DECLARES THAT, BY PROHIBITING THE MARKETING OF BEERS LAWFULLY MANUFACTURED AND MARKETED IN ANOTHER MEMBER STATE IF THEY DO NOT COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS LAID DOWN IN THE GREEK LEGISLATION, THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE 30 OF THE EEC TREATY;  ( 2 ) ORDERS THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC TO PAY THE COSTS .  
ON THOSE GROUNDS,  THE COURT  HEREBY :  ( 1 ) DECLARES THAT, BY PROHIBITING THE MARKETING OF BEERS LAWFULLY MANUFACTURED AND MARKETED IN ANOTHER MEMBER STATE IF THEY DO NOT COMPLY WITH ARTICLES 9 AND 10 OF THE BIERSTEUERGESETZ, THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE 30 OF THE EEC TREATY;  ( 2 ) ORDERS THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY TO PAY THE COSTS .  
On those grounds,  THE COURT ( Third Chamber )  in answer to the question referred to it by the tribunal de première instance de Dinant by a judgment of 6 March 1986, hereby rules :  Neither Article 30 of the EEC Treaty, nor any other provision of the EEC Treaty, nor any general principle of Community law makes it unlawful for certain provisions of national legislation, themselves in conformity with a Community directive, to apply only to domestically-produced products, to the exclusion of those coming from other Member States .  
On those grounds  THE COURT ( Third Chamber )  in reply to the question referred to it for a preliminary ruling by the tribunal de commerce, L' Aigle, by judgment of 15 June 1987, as supplemented by a judgment of 21 September 1987, hereby rules :  ( 1 ) Article 30 of the Treaty precludes a Member State from applying to products imported from another Member State, where they are lawfully manufactured and marketed, national rules which reserve the right to use the name "yoghurt" solely to fresh yoghurt, to the exclusion of deep-frozen yoghurt, when the characteristics of the latter product are not substantially different from those of the fresh product, and when appropriate labelling, together with an indication of the date by which the product should be sold or consumed, is sufficient to ensure that consumers are properly informed .  ( 2 ) The provisions of Directive 79/112/EEC, in particular Article 5, must be interpreted as precluding the application of national rules which refuse to allow imported or domestic products which have been deep-frozen to bear the name "yoghurt", where those products, for the rest, comply with the requirements laid down by the national rules for fresh products to bear that name .  
On those grounds,  THE COURT ( Fifth Chamber ),  in answer to the question submitted to it by the cour d' appel de Paris, by a judgment of 27 November 1987, hereby rules :  The application to imported products of a prohibition on canvassing in relation to the sale of educational material such as that laid down by the law on the protection of consumers with respect to canvassing and to selling at private dwellings is not incompatible with Article 30 of the Treaty .  
( 1 ) Declares that, by failing to adopt within the prescribed period all the measures necessary to implement Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 relating to the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning misleading advertising, the Kingdom of Belgium has failed to fulfil its obligations under the EEC Treaty;  ( 2 ) Orders the Kingdom of Belgium to pay the costs .  
( 1 ) Declares that, by failing to adopt within the prescribed period the measures necessary to implement Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 relating to the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning misleading advertising, the Hellenic Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under the EEC Treaty;  ( 2 ) Orders the Hellenic Republic to pay the costs .  
On those grounds,  THE COURT ( Sixth Chamber ),  in answer to the question submitted to it by the Cour de cassation of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, by order of 8 December 1988, hereby rules :  Under Articles 30 and 36 of the EEC Treaty, properly interpreted, advertising lawfully distributed in another Member State cannot be made subject to national legislation prohibiting the inclusion, in advertisements relating to a special purchase offer, of a statement showing the duration of the offer or the previous price .  
On those grounds,  THE COURT ( Sixth Chamber ),  in answer to the question submitted to it by the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris, by judgment of 5 July 1989, hereby rules :  ( 1 ) The provisions of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer, and in particular Articles 2 and 15, must be interpreted as meaning that they preclude the application to national and imported products of national provisions which prohibit any statement in the labelling of artificial sweeteners alluding to the word "sugar" or to the physical, chemical or nutritional properties of sugar that artificial sweeteners also possess .  ( 2 ) Articles 30 and 36 of the EEC Treaty must be interpreted as meaning that they preclude the application to imported products of national provisions which prohibit any statement in the advertising of artificial sweeteners alluding to the word "sugar" or to the physical, chemical or nutritional properties of sugar that artificial sweeteners also possess .  
On those grounds,  THE COURT (First Chamber),  in answer to the questions referred to it by the Cour d' Appel de Paris by judgment dated 17 November 1989, hereby rules:  (1) A trader canvassed with a view to the conclusion of an advertising contract concerning the sale of his business is not to be regarded as a consumer protected by Council Directive 85/577/EEC of 20 December 1985 to protect the consumer in respect of contracts negotiated away from business premises;  (2) That directive does not preclude national legislation on canvassing from extending the protection which it affords to cover traders acting with a view to the sale of their business.  
On those grounds,  THE COURT (Fifth Chamber),  in reply to the question referred to it by the Rechtbank van Koophandel, Louvain, by order of 5 December 1989, hereby rules:  Article 30 of the EEC Treaty and Article 14 of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer preclude a national law from requiring the exclusive use of a specific language for the labelling of foodstuffs, without allowing for the possibility of using another language easily understood by purchasers or of ensuring that the purchaser is informed by other measures.  
1. By requiring manufacturers of extruded pasta products to state on the label the date of manufacture and the place of origin or provenance of the product, the Italian Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under points 4 and 7 of Article 3(1) of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer (Official Journal 1979 L 33, p. 1);  2. The Italian Republic is ordered to pay the costs.  
On those grounds,  THE COURT (Fifth Chamber),  in answer to the question referred to it by the Examining Magistrate of the Tribunal de Grande Instance, Bergerac, by a letter of 12 December 1990, hereby rules :  Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 relating to the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning misleading advertising must be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude vehicles from being advertised as new, less expensive and guaranteed by the manufacturer when the vehicles concerned are registered solely for the purpose of importation, have never been on the road, and are sold in a Member State at a price lower than that charged by dealers established in that Member State because they are equipped with fewer accessories.  
On those grounds,  THE COURT (Fifth Chamber),  in answer to the questions referred to it by the Consiglio di Stato in Sede Giurisdizionale, by order of 27 August 1991, hereby rules:  1. Article 4(5) of Council Directive 89/622/EEC of 13 November 1989 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the labelling of tobacco products, in its original version, is to be interpreted as meaning that Member States may not require that, so far as national production is concerned, on unit packets of tobacco products other than cigarette packets the general warning referred to in Article 4(1) must cover at least 4% of the surface on which it is printed. Member States may, however, impose such a requirement under the version of Article 4(5) laid down in Council Directive 92/41/EEC of 15 May 1992 amending Directive 89/622.  2. Article 4(2) of Directive 89/622 requires only one specific warning to be printed on each cigarette packet and Member States may not therefore require more than one such warning.  
On those grounds,  THE COURT (Fifth Chamber)  in answer to the question referred to it by the High Court of Justice of England and Wales (Queen' s Bench Division) by order of 12 December 1991, hereby rules:  Articles 3(3) and 4(4) of Council Directive 89/622/EEC of 13 November 1989 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the labelling of tobacco products are to be interpreted as allowing the Member States to require, so far as domestic production is concerned, that the indications of tar and nicotine yields provided for in Article 3 of that directive and the general and specific warnings provided for in Article 4 of the directive be printed on cigarette packets so as to cover at least 6% of each of the relevant surface areas.  
On those grounds,  THE COURT  hereby:  1. Declares that, by failing to communicate the laws, regulations and administrative provisions by which it considers itself to have fulfilled its obligations under Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products (OJ 1985 L 210, p. 29), or by failing to adopt the measures necessary to comply therewith, the French Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under the directive and under the Treaty;  2. Orders the French Republic to pay the costs.  
On those grounds,  THE COURT (Sixth Chamber),  in answer to the question referred to it by the Arrondissementsrechtbank, Leeuwarden (Netherlands), by order of 15 June 1992, hereby rules:  Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer is to be interpreted as meaning that a national cheese mark comprising not only particulars of the country of production and the type of cheese, but also one or two letters varying according to the region of production, a serial number and a combination of letters or of letters and numbers, does not constitute labelling within the meaning of Article 1(3)(a) of that directive and therefore does not fall within its scope.  
On those grounds,  THE COURT,  in answer to the question referred to it by the Giudice Conciliatore di Firenze, by order of 24 January 1992, hereby rules:  Article 1(1), Article 2 and Article 5 of Council Directive 85/577/EEC of 20 December 1985, concerning protection of the consumer in respect of contracts negotiated away from business premises, are unconditional and sufficiently precise as regards determination of the persons for whose benefit they were adopted and the minimum period within which notice of cancellation must be given.  In the absence of measures transposing Directive 85/577 within the prescribed time-limit, consumers cannot derive from the directive itself a right of cancellation as against traders with whom they have concluded a contract or enforce such a right in a national court. However, when applying provisions of national law, whether adopted before or after the directive, the national court must interpret them as far as possible in the light of the wording and purpose of the directive.  
On those grounds,  THE COURT (Fifth Chamber),  in answer to the questions referred to it by the Rechtbank van Eerste Aanleg, Ghent, by judgment of 15 January 1993, hereby rules:  1. National legislation prohibiting the marketing of bread and other bakery products whose salt content by reference to the dry matter exceeds the maximum permitted level of 2%, when applied to products which have been lawfully manufactured and marketed in another Member State, constitutes a measure having equivalent effect to a quantitative restriction within the meaning of Article 30 of the EEC Treaty.  2. Rules such as those at issue in the main proceedings are likely to hinder trade between Member States and cannot be regarded as justified under Article 36 of the EEC Treaty on the ground of protecting public health.  3. In the context of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer, a Member State which had made it obligatory to designate, as provided by the second indent of Article 6(5)(b), either the specific name or the EEC number of the ingredients listed in Annex II to that directive, was entitled to rely on the imperative requirement of protecting consumers in order to prohibit the marketing of a product from another Member State which had chosen to exercise the option allowed by Article 23(1)(a) of that directive and to require only designation of the general category "preservative".  
On those grounds,  THE COURT  hereby:  1. Dismisses the application.  2. Orders the Federal Republic of Germany to pay the costs and the Commission, as intervener, to bear its own costs.  
On those grounds,  THE COURT (Fifth Chamber)  hereby:  1. Dismisses the application as inadmissible;  2. Orders the applicant to pay the costs.  
On those grounds,  THE COURT (First Chamber),  in answer to the question referred to it by the Bundesverwaltungsgericht, by order of 26 November 1992, hereby rules:  On a proper construction of the first indent of Article 6(4)(c)(ii) of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer, an additive preventing discoloration of an ingredient during its manufacture no longer serves a technological function in the finished product, where its presence in the finished product is no longer necessary to prevent the discoloration of that product.  
On those grounds,  THE COURT (Fifth Chamber),  in answer to the questions referred to it by the Hof van Beroep, Brussels, by judgment of 24 February 1994, hereby rules:  1. Article 14 of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer precludes a Member State, with regard to the use of a language easily understood by purchasers, from requiring the use of a language which is that most widely spoken in the area in which the product is offered for sale, even if the use at the same time of another language is not excluded.  2. All the compulsory particulars specified in Directive 79/112 must appear on the labelling in a language easily understood by consumers in the State or region concerned or by means of other measures such as designs, symbols or pictograms. The ease with which the information supplied can be understood must be assessed in the light of all the circumstances in each individual case.  
On those grounds,  THE COURT (Fifth Chamber)  hereby:  1. Declares that, by requiring that béarnaise sauce and hollandaise sauce made with vegetable fats and certain pastry products containing the additive "E 160 F" should, in order to be marketed in Germany, carry a trade description with an additional statement indicating that the substance in question has been used, even if that substance is already included in the list of ingredients referred to in Article 6 of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer, the Federal Republic of Germany has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 30 of the EC Treaty;  2. Dismisses the remainder of the application;  3. Orders the Federal Republic of Germany to pay the costs.  
On those grounds,THE COURT, in answer to the questions referred to it by the Landgericht Bonn, by orders of 6 June 1994, hereby rules: 1. Failure to take any measure to transpose a directive in order to achieve the result it prescribes within the period laid down for that purpose constitutes per se a serious breach of Community law and consequently gives rise to a right of reparation for individuals suffering injury if the result prescribed by the directive entails the grant to individuals of rights whose content is identifiable and a causal link exists between the breach of the State' s obligation and the loss and damage suffered. 2. The result prescribed by Article 7 of Council Directive 90/314/EEC of 13 June 1990 on package travel, package holidays and package tours entails the grant to package travellers of rights guaranteeing a refund of money paid over and their repatriation in the event of the organizer' s insolvency; the content of those rights is sufficiently identifiable. 3. In order to comply with Article 9 of Directive 90/314, the Member States should have adopted, within the period prescribed, all the measures necessary to ensure that, as from 1 January 1993, individuals would have effective protection against the risk of the insolvency of the organizer and/or retailer party to the contract. 4. If a Member State allows the package travel organizer and/or retailer party to a contract to require payment of a deposit of up to 10% towards the travel price, with a maximum of DM 500, the protective purpose pursued by Article 7 of Directive 90/314 is not satisfied unless a refund of that deposit is also guaranteed in the event of the insolvency of the package travel organizer and/or retailer party to the contract. 5. Article 7 of Directive 90/314 is to be interpreted as meaning that the "security" of which organizers must offer sufficient evidence is lacking even if, on payment of the travel price, travellers are in possession of documents of value and that the Federal Republic of Germany could not have omitted altogether to transpose Directive 90/314 on the basis of the Bundesgerichtshof' s "advance payment" judgment of 12 March 1987. 6. Directive 90/314 does not require Member States to adopt specific measures in relation to Article 7 in order to protect package travellers against their own negligence.  

On those grounds,THE COURT (Fifth Chamber), in answer to the question referred to it by the French Cour de Cassation by judgments of 3 October 1994, hereby rules: 1. Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs does not preclude application of domestic rules, such as those laid down by Article 34 of Law No 85-30 of 9 January 1985 and Decree No 88-194 of 26 February 1988, which lay down the conditions governing the use of the description `mountain' in relation to agricultural products and foodstuffs. 2. Article 30 of the EC Treaty precludes application of domestic rules, such as those laid down by Article 34 of Law No 85-30 and Decree No 88-194, which restrict use of the description `mountain' to products manufactured on national territory and prepared from domestic raw materials.  
On those grounds,THE COURT (Fifth Chamber) hereby: 1. Dismisses the application; 2. Orders the Commission to pay the costs.  
On those grounds,THE COURT (First Chamber), in answer to the question referred to it by the Corte Suprema di Cassazione by order of 4 December 1995, hereby rules: Article 3(1)(6) of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer is to be interpreted as meaning that the expression `established within the Community' used in it refers only to the seller.  
On those grounds,THE COURT (Sixth Chamber) hereby: 1. Dismisses the application; 2. Orders the European Parliament to pay the costs; 3. Orders the Kingdom of Sweden and the Commission to bear their own costs.  
On those grounds,THE COURT (Fifth Chamber), in answer to the question referred to it by the Bundesgerichtshof by order of 11 January 1996, hereby rules: On a proper construction of the first indent of Article 2 of Directive 85/577/EEC of 20 December 1985 to protect the consumer in respect of contracts negotiated away from business premises, a contract of guarantee concluded by a natural person who is not acting in the course of his trade or profession does not come within the scope of the directive where it guarantees repayment of a debt contracted by another person who, for his part, is acting within the course of his trade or profession.  
On those grounds,THE COURT (Fifth Chamber), in answer to the question referred to it by the Bezirksgericht für Handelssachen Wien by order of 21 October 1996, hereby rules: Article 7 of Council Directive 90/314/EEC of 13 June 1990 on package travel, package holidays and package tours is to be interpreted as covering, as security for the refund of money paid over, a situation in which the purchaser of a package holiday who has paid the travel organiser for the costs of his accommodation before travelling on his holiday is compelled, following the travel organiser's insolvency, to pay the hotelier for his accommodation again in order to be able to leave the hotel and return home.  
On those grounds,THE COURT, in answer to the questions referred to it by the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Dijon by judgments of 26 February 1997, hereby rules: 1. Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs must be interpreted as meaning that, since its entry into force, a Member State may not, by adopting provisions of national law, alter a designation of origin for which it has requested registration in accordance with Article 17 and protect that designation at national level. 2. As regards a `compound' designation of origin, the fact that there is no footnote in the annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1107/96 of 12 June 1996 on the registration of geographical indications and designations of origin under the procedure laid down in Article 17 of Regulation No 2081/92 specifying that registration is not sought for one of the parts of that designation does not necessarily mean that each of its constituent parts is protected.  
On those grounds,THE COURT (Fifth Chamber), in answer to the questions referred to it by the Amtsgericht Aachen by order of 6 November 1996, hereby rules: 27 Article 14 of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer does not preclude national legislation which, as regards language requirements, prescribes the use of a specific language for the labelling of foodstuffs but which also permits, as an alternative, the use of another language easily understood by purchasers. 2. All the compulsory particulars specified in Directive 79/112 must appear on the labelling either in a language easily understood by consumers of the State or the region in question, or by means of other measures such as designs, symbols or pictograms.  The placing in the shop of a supplementary sign adjacent to the product in question is not sufficient to ensure that the ultimate consumer is informed and protected.  
On those grounds, THE COURT, in answer to the question referred to it by the Tribunal de Grande Instance, Metz, by judgment of 19 December 1996, hereby rules: It is contrary to Article 59 of the EC Treaty and to Second Council Directive 89/646/EEC of 15 December 1989 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions and amending Directive 77/780/EEC and Council Directive 92/49/EEC of 18 June 1992 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to direct insurance other than life assurance and amending Directives 73/239/EEC and 88/357/EEC (third non-life insurance Directive) for national rules to require, with a view to implementing Article 7 of Council Directive 90/314/EEC of 13 June 1990 on package travel, package holidays and package tours, that, where financial security is provided by a credit institution or insurance company situated in another Member State, the guarantor must conclude an agreement with a credit institution or insurance company situated in France. 
On those grounds, THE COURT (Third Chamber) hereby: 1. Declares that, by failing to adopt within the prescribed period the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with Directive 94/47/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 26 October 1994 on the protection of purchasers in respect of certain aspects of contracts relating to the purchase of the right to use immovable properties on a timeshare basis, the Kingdom of Belgium has failed to fulfil its obligations under that directive; 2. Orders the Kingdom of Belgium to pay the costs. 
On those grounds, THE COURT (Fifth Chamber), in answer to the questions referred to it by the Handelsgericht Wien by order of 18 July 1996, hereby rules: In the present state of Community law, the principle of the free movement of goods does not preclude Member States from taking the measures incumbent upon them in order to ensure the protection of designations of origin registered under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs.  Use of a name such as `Cambozola' may therefore be deemed, for the purposes of Article 13(1)(b) of that regulation, to evoke the protected designation of origin `Gorgonzola', irrespective of the fact that the packaging indicates the product's true origin.  It is for the national court to decide whether, on the facts, the conditions laid down in Article 14(2) of Regulation No 2081/92 allow use of an earlier trade mark to continue notwithstanding the registration of the protected designation of origin `Gorgonzola', having regard in particular to the law in force at the time of registration of the trade mark, in order to determine whether such registration could have been made in good faith, on the basis that use of a name such as `Cambozola' does not, per se, constitute an attempt to deceive the consumer. 
On those grounds, THE COURT hereby: 1. Annuls Commission Regulation (EC) No 1107/96 of 12 June 1996 on the registration of geographical indications and designations of origin under the procedure laid down in Article 17 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 to the extent to which it registered `Feta' as a protected designation of origin; 2. Orders the Commission of the European Communities to pay the costs; 3. Orders the Hellenic republic to bear its own costs. 
On those grounds, THE COURT (Third Chamber), in answer to the questions referred to it by the Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Valencia by order of 11 November 1997, hereby rules: 1. Council Directive 85/577/EEC of 20 December 1985 to protect the consumer in respect of contracts negotiated away from business premises applies to a contract relating to the acquisition of a right to use immoveable property on a time-share basis and to the provision of services whose value is higher than that of the right to use the immoveable property. 2. A contract concluded in a situation in which a trader has invited a consumer to go in person to a specified place at a certain distance from the place where the consumer lives and which is different from the premises where the trader usually carries on his business and is not clearly identified as premises for sales to the public, in order to present to him the products and services he is offering, must be considered to have been concluded during an excursion organised by the trader away from his business premises within the meaning of Directive 85/577. 3. The consumer can exercise his right of renunciation under Article 5(1) of Directive 85/577 where the contract has been concluded in circumstances such as those described in Article 1 of that directive, without there being any need to prove that the consumer was influenced or manipulated by the trader. 4. Directive 85/577 does not preclude a Member State from adopting rules providing that the notice of renunciation provided for by Article 5(1) of the directive is not subject to any condition as to form. 5. Directive 85/577 precludes the inclusion in a contract of a clause imposing payment by the consumer of a lump sum for damage caused to the trader for the sole reason that the consumer has exercised his right of renunciation. 
On those grounds, THE COURT, in answer to the questions referred to it by the Landesgericht Linz by order of 26 March 1997, hereby rules: 1. Article 7 of Council Directive 90/314/EEC of 13 June 1990 on package travel, package holidays and package tours applies to trips which are offered by a daily newspaper as a gift exclusively to its subscribers as part of an advertising campaign that contravenes national competition law and for which the principal contractor, if he travels alone, pays airport taxes and a single-room supplement or, if he is accompanied by one or more persons paying the full rate, airport taxes only. 2. A Member State which acceded to the European Union on 1 January 1995 has not properly transposed Article 7 of Directive 90/314 if it has adopted legislation which protects travellers who have booked package travel after 1 January 1995 but limits that protection to trips with a departure date of 1 May 1995 or later. 3. Transposition of Article 7 of Directive 90/314 in a way that limits the protection prescribed by that provision to trips with a departure date four months or more after the expiry of the period prescribed for transposing the directive constitutes a sufficiently serious breach of Community law, even where the Member State has implemented all the other provisions of the directive. 4. Article 7 of Directive 90/314 has not been properly transposed where national legislation does no more than require, for the coverage of the risk, a contract of insurance or a bank guarantee under which the amount of cover provided must be no less than 5% of the organiser's turnover during the corresponding quarter of the previous calendar year, and which requires an organiser just starting up in business to base the amount of cover on his estimated turnover from his intended business as a travel organiser and does not take account of any increase in the organiser's turnover in the current year. 5. Once a direct causal link has been established, a Member State's liability for breach of Article 7 of Directive 90/314 cannot be precluded by imprudent conduct on the part of the travel organiser or by the occurrence of exceptional or unforeseeable events. 
On those grounds, THE COURT (Fifth Chamber), hereby: 1. Declares that, by failing to adopt within the prescribed period the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with Directive 94/47/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 26 October 1994 on the protection of purchasers in respect of certain aspects of contracts relating to the purchase of the right to use immovable properties on a timeshare basis, the Hellenic Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under that directive; 2. Orders the Hellenic Republic to pay the costs. 
On those grounds, THE COURT (First Chamber), in answer to the question referred to it by the Amtsgericht Nordhorn by order of 30 October 1997, hereby rules: It is contrary to Article 30 of the EC Treaty for national rules to prohibit, for reasons of consumer protection, the marketing of foodstuffs lawfully manufactured and marketed in another Member State, where consumers are protected by means of labelling in accordance with the provisions of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs, in particular those concerning the description of products and the list of ingredients. It is contrary to Articles 2 and 5(1) of Directive 79/112 to use a trade description which does not make it possible for purchasers in the State where the product is sold to ascertain the true nature of the foodstuff. Where the quantity of added water represents more than 5% by weight of the finished product, failure to include `water' in the list of ingredients constitutes infringement of Article 3(1), read in conjunction with Article 6(5)(a), of Directive 79/112. 
On those grounds,THE COURT (Fifth Chamber),in answer to the question referred to it by the Landgericht Potsdam by order of 27 April 1998, hereby rules:On a proper construction of Council Directive 87/102/EEC of 22 December 1986 for the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning consumer credit, it does not cover a contract of guarantee for repayment of credit where neither the guarantor nor the borrower was acting in the course of his trade or profession. 
On those grounds,THE COURT (First Chamber),in answer to the question referred to it by the Oberlandesgericht Köln by order of 2 December 1998, hereby rules:Article 2(1)(a)(i) of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer does not preclude use of the description naturally pure for a strawberry jam which contains the gelling agent pectin and traces or residues of lead, cadmium and pesticides of the following levels: 0.01 mg/kg of lead, 0.008 mg/kg of cadmium, 0.016 mg/kg of procymidone and 0.005 mg/kg of vinclozolin. 
On those grounds,THE COURT,in answer to the questions referred to it by the Juzgado de Primera Instancia No 35 de Barcelona by orders of 31 March and 1 April 1998, hereby rules:1. The protection provided for consumers by Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts entails the national court being able to determine of its own motion whether a term of a contract before it is unfair when making its preliminary assessment as to whether a claim should be allowed to proceed before the national courts.2. The national court is obliged, when it applies national law provisions predating or postdating the said Directive, to interpret those provisions, so far as possible, in the light of the wording and purpose of the Directive. The requirement for an interpretation in conformity with the Directive requires the national court, in particular, to favour the interpretation that would allow it to decline of its own motion the jurisdiction conferred on it by virtue of an unfair term. 
On those grounds,THE COURT,in answer to the question referred to it by the Cour d'Appel, Lyon, by judgment of 16 September 1998, hereby rules:1. Article 30 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 28 EC) and Article 14 of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs, as amended by Commission Directive 93/102/EC of 16 November 1993, do not preclude a national provision from requiring that the labelling of foodstuffs and the labelling methods used must not mislead the purchaser or consumer, particularly as to the characteristics of those foodstuffs.2. Article 30 of the Treaty and Article 14 of Directive 79/112 preclude a national provision from requiring the use of a specific language for the labelling of foodstuffs, without allowing for the possibility for another language easily understood by purchasers to be used or for the purchaser to be informed by other means. 
On those grounds,THE COURTin answer to the question referred to it by the Bundesgerichtshof, by order of 2 July 1998, hereby rules:Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs does not preclude the application of national legislation which prohibits the potentially misleading use of a geographical indication of source in the case of which there is no link between the characteristics of the product and its geographical provenance. 
On those grounds,THE COURT (Fifth Chamber),hereby:1. Declares that, by failing to adopt the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary for the full transposition into national law of Articles 4(2) and 5 of Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts, the Kingdom of the Netherlands has failed to fulfil its obligations under that Directive;2. Orders the Kingdom of the Netherlands to pay the costs. 
On those grounds,THE COURT (Fifth Chamber),in answer to the questions referred to it by the Højesteret by judgment of 21 May 1999, hereby rules:1. Article 7(a) of Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products is to be interpreted as meaning that a defective product is put into circulation when it is used during the provision of a specific medical service, consisting in preparing a human organ for transplantation, and the damage caused to the organ results from that preparatory treatment.2. Article 7(c) of Directive 85/374 is to be interpreted as meaning that the exemption from liability where an activity has no economic or business purpose does not extend to the case of a defective product which has been manufactured and used in the course of a specific medical service which is financed entirely from public funds and for which the patient is not required to pay any consideration.3. Article 9 of Directive 85/374 is to be interpreted as meaning that, save for non-material damage whose reparation is governed solely by national law and the exclusions detailed in that article as regards damage to an item of property, a Member State may not restrict the types of material damage, resulting from death or from personal injury, or from damage to or destruction of an item of property, which are to be made good.4. The national court is required, under Directive 85/374, to examine under which head the circumstances of the case are to be categorised, namely whether the case concerns damage covered either by point (a) or by point (b) of the first paragraph of Article 9 or non-material damage which may possibly be covered by national law. The national court may, however, not decline to award any damages at all under the Directive on the ground that, where the other conditions of liability are fulfilled, the damage incurred is not such as to fall under any of the foregoing heads. 
On those grounds,THE COURT (Fifth Chamber),in answer to the questions referred to it by the Landgericht Düsseldorf by order of 19 January 1999, hereby rules:1. On a proper construction of Articles 2(2a) and 3a(1)(c) of Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 concerning misleading and comparative advertising, as amended by Directive 97/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 October 1997, the indication, in the catalogue of a supplier of spare parts and consumable items suitable for the products of an equipment manufacturer, of product numbers (OEM numbers) by which the equipment manufacturer designates the spare parts and consumable items which he himself sells may constitute comparative advertising which objectively compares one or more material, relevant, verifiable and representative features of goods.2. On a proper construction of Article 3a(1)(g) of Directive 84/450 as amended by Directive 97/55, where product numbers (OEM numbers) of an equipment manufacturer are, as such, distinguishing marks within the meaning of that provision, their use in the catalogues of a competing supplier enables him to take unfair advantage of the reputation attached to those marks only if the effect of the reference to them is to create, in the mind of the persons at whom the advertising is directed, an association between the manufacturer whose products are identified and the competing supplier, in that those persons associate the reputation of the manufacturer's products with the products of the competing supplier. In order to determine whether that condition is satisfied, account should be taken of the overall presentation of the advertising at issue and the type of persons for whom the advertising is intended. 
On those grounds,THE COURT (Third Chamber),in answer to the questions referred to it by the Giudice di pace di Viadana by orders of 12 November 1999, hereby rules:The term consumer, as defined in Article 2(b) of Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts, must be interpreted as referring solely to natural persons. 
On those grounds,THE COURT (Sixth Chamber)in answer to the questions referred to it by the Bundesgerichtshof by order of 29 November 1999, hereby rules:1. Council Directive 85/577/EEC of 20 December 1985 to protect the consumer in respect of contracts negotiated away from business premises is to be interpreted as applying to a secured-credit agreement such as that in point in the main proceedings, with the result that the right of cancellation provided for in Article 5 of that directive is available to a consumer who has entered into a contract of that type in one of the cases specified in Article 1.2. Directive 85/577 precludes the national legislature from imposing a time-limit of one year from the conclusion of the contract within which the right of cancellation provided for in Article 5 of that directive may be exercised, where the consumer has not received the information specified in Article 4. 
On those grounds,THE COURT (Sixth Chamber),in answer to the question referred to it by the Landesgericht Linz by order of 6 April 2000, hereby rules:Article 5 of Council Directive 90/314/EEC of 13 June 1990 on package travel, package holidays and package tours is to be interpreted as conferring, in principle, on consumers a right to compensation for non-material damage resulting from the non-performance or improper performance of the services constituting a package holiday. 
On those grounds,THE COURT (Fifth Chamber)hereby:1. Declares that- by including damage of less than EUR 500 in Article 1386-2 of the French Civil Code;- by providing in the first paragraph of Article 1386-7 thereof that the supplier of a defective product is to be liable in all cases and on the same basis as the producer, and- by providing in the second paragraph of Article 1386-12 thereof that the producer must prove that he has taken appropriate steps to avert the consequences of a defective product in order to be able to rely on the grounds of exemption from liability provided for in Article 7(d) and (e) of Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products,the French Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 9(b), 3(3) and 7 of the aforementioned directive;2. Orders the French Republic to pay the costs. 
On those grounds, THE COURT (Fifth Chamber) hereby: 1. Declares that, by not making provision in the national legislation transposing Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products for the threshold of EUR 500 referred to in Article 9(b) of the Directive, the Hellenic Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under that provision; 2. Orders the Hellenic Republic to pay the costs. 
On those grounds,THE COURT (Fifth Chamber),in answer to the question submitted to it by the Juzgado de Primera Instancia e Instrucción no 5 de Oviedo by order of 13 April 2000, hereby rules:Article 13 of Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products must be interpreted as meaning that the rights conferred under the legislation of a Member State on the victims of damage caused by a defective product under a general system of liability having the same basis as that put in place by the Directive may be limited or restricted as a result of the Directive's transposition into the domestic law of that State. 
On those grounds,THE COURT (Third Chamber),in answer to the questions referred to it by the Tribunal Judicial da Comarca do Porto by decision of 31 October 2000, hereby rules:1. The term package used in Council Directive 90/314/EEC of 13 June 1990 on package travel, package holidays and package tours, must be interpreted so as to include holidays organised by travel agents, at the request of and in accordance with the specifications of a consumer or limited group of consumers.2. The term pre-organised combination used in Article 2(1) of Directive 90/314 must be interpreted so as to include combinations of tourist services put together at the time when the contract is concluded between the travel agency and the consumer. 
On those grounds,THE COURT (Fifth Chamber),hereby:1. Dismisses the application;2. Orders the Commission of the European Communities to pay the costs;3. Orders the Kingdom of Denmark and the Republic of Finland to bear their own costs. 
On those grounds,THE COURT,in answer to the questions referred to it by the Tribunale di Parma by order of 21 February 2000, hereby rules:On a proper construction of Article 13(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 535/97 of 17 March 1997, products are not covered by the system of derogations set up by Article 13(2) where they originate in the State of the protected designation of origin the protection of which under Article 13(1)(a) and (b) of Regulation No 2081/92, as amended, is at issue and they do not meet the product specification for that protected designation of origin. 
On those grounds,THE COURT (Fifth Chamber)hereby:1. Declares that, by failing to adopt the measures necessary to transpose in full Article 7(3) of Council Directive 93/13/CEE of 5 December 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts, the Italian Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under the Directive;2. Orders the Italian Republic to pay the costs. 
On those grounds,THE COURT (First Chamber),hereby:1. Declares that, by failing to adopt within the prescribed period the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with Directive 98/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 amending Directive 87/102/EEC for the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning consumer credit, the Kingdom of Spain has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 2(1) of that directive.2. Orders the Kingdom of Spain to pay the costs. 
On those grounds,THE COURT (Sixth Chamber),in answer to the questions referred to it by the Verwaltungsgerichtshof by order of 29 January 2001, hereby rules:1. Article 6(3) of Council Directive 76/768/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products, as amended by Council Directive 93/35/EEC of 14 June 1993, precludes national legislation which prohibits reference to expert medical opinions in the marketing of cosmetic products - in particular, the use of the statement dermatologically tested' - if that reference does not include information relating to the contents and outcome of those assessments.2. Article 6(3) of Directive 76/768 as amended by Directive 93/35 precludes national legislation which authorises the use of information as referred to in Question 1 only on condition that prior authorisation is granted by the competent Minister. 
On those grounds, THE COURT (Fifth Chamber), in answer to the question referred to it by the Tribunal d'instance de Vienne by judgment of 15 December 2000, rectified by judgment of 26 January 2001, hereby rules: Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts precludes a national provision which, in proceedings brought by a seller or supplier against a consumer on the basis of a contract concluded between them, prohibits the national court, on expiry of a limitation period, from finding, of its own motion or following a plea raised by the consumer, that a term of the contract is unfair. 
On those grounds, THE COURT (Third Chamber), hereby: 1. Declares that, by failing to adopt, within the prescribed period, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with Directive 97/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 October 1997 amending Directive 84/450/EEC concerning misleading advertising so as to include comparative advertising, the Kingdom of Spain has failed to fulfil its obligations under that directive. 2. Orders the Kingdom of Spain to pay the costs. 
On those grounds, THE COURT (Second Chamber) hereby: 1. Declares that by failing to adopt within the prescribed period the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with Directive 97/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 1997 on the protection of consumers in respect of distance contracts the Kingdom of Spain has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 15(1) of that directive; 2. Orders the Kingdom of Spain to pay the costs.

 Consideration of the first question has not disclosed any factor of such a kind as to affect the validity of Directive 2001/37/EC
            of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2001 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative
            provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products.

 Article 7 of Directive 2001/37 is to be construed as applying only to tobacco products marketed within the European Community.
            
            

 Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the
               Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs does not preclude a national rule which
               provides that, where the period of minimum durability of a foodstuff expired, that fact must be indicated separately, clearly
               and in a generally intelligible manner. Such a rule is a non-harmonised national provision justified on the ground of prevention
               of fraud as provided for in Article 18(2) of the directive. Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the
               Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs does not preclude a national rule which

               of fraud as provided for in Article 18(2) of the directive.

 Article 7(2) of Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 on misleading and comparative advertising, as amended by
            Directive 97/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 October 1997, precludes the application to comparative
            advertising of stricter national provisions on protection against misleading advertising as far as the form and content of
            the comparison is concerned, without there being any need to establish distinctions between the various elements of the comparison,
            that is to say statements concerning the advertiser's offer, statements concerning the competitor's offer and the relationship
            between those offers. 
            

2.
 Article 3a(1)(a) of Directive 84/450, as amended, must be interpreted as meaning that, whereas the advertiser is in principle
            free to state or not to state the brand name of rival products in comparative advertising, it is for the national court to
            verify whether, in particular circumstances, characterised by the importance of the brand in the buyer's choice and by a major
            difference between the respective brand names of the compared products in terms of how well known they are, omission of the
            better-known brand name is capable of being misleading. 
            

3.
 Article 3a(1) of Directive 84/450, as amended, does not preclude compared products from being purchased through different
            distribution channels.  
            

4.
 Article 3a(1) of Directive 84/450, as amended, does not preclude an advertiser from carrying out a test purchase with a competitor
            before his own offer has even commenced, where the conditions for the lawfulness of comparative advertising set out therein
            are complied with. 
            

5.
 A price comparison does not entail the discrediting of a competitor, within the meaning of Article 3a(1)(e) of Directive 84/450,
            as amended, either on the grounds that the difference in price between the products compared is greater than the average price
            difference or by reason of the number of comparisons made.  Article 3a(1)(e) of Directive 84/450, as amended, does not prevent
            comparative advertising, in addition to citing the competitor's name, from reproducing its logo and a picture of its shop
            front, if that advertising complies with the conditions for lawfulness laid down by Community law. 
            



1.
 As regards the period prior to the entry into force of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1107/96 of 12 June 1996 on the registration
            of geographical indications and designations of origin under the procedure laid down in Article 17 of Council Regulation (EEC)
            No 2081/92, Article 29 EC must be interpreted as not precluding a convention concluded between two Member States A and B,
            such as the Convention between the French Republic and the Italian Republic on the protection of designations of origin, indications
            of provenance and names of certain products, signed in Rome on 28 April 1964, from making applicable in Member State A national
            legislation of Member State B, such as that referred to by the national court, under which the designation of origin of a
            cheese, protected in Member State B, is reserved, for cheese marketed in grated form, to cheese grated and packaged in the
            region of production. 
            

2.
 Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin
            for agricultural products and foodstuffs, as amended by the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of
            Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden and the adjustments to the Treaties on which the European Union
            is founded, must be interpreted as not precluding the use of a protected designation of origin from being subject to the condition
            that operations such as the grating and packaging of the product take place in the region of production, where such a condition
            is laid down in the specification. 
            

3.
 Where the use of the protected designation of origin  
            Grana Padano for cheese marketed in grated form is made subject to the condition that grating and packaging operations be carried out
            in the region of production, this constitutes a measure having equivalent effect to a quantitative restriction on exports
            within the meaning of Article 29 EC, but may be regarded as justified, and hence compatible with that provision. 
            

4.
 However, the condition in question may not be relied on against economic operators, as it was not brought to their knowledge
            by adequate publicity in Community legislation. Nevertheless, the principle of legal certainty does not preclude that condition
            from being regarded by the national court as capable of being relied on against operators who carried on the activity of grating
            and packaging the product in the period prior to the entry into force of Regulation No 1107/96, should that court consider
            that during that period the Decree of 4 November 1991 was applicable by virtue of the aforesaid Convention between the French
            Republic and the Italian Republic and capable of being relied on against those concerned by virtue of the national rules on
            publicity.

            Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden and the adjustments to the Treaties on which the European Union
            is founded, must be interpreted as not precluding the use of a protected designation of origin from being subject to the condition
            that operations such as the slicing and packaging of the product take place in the region of production, where such a condition
            is laid down in the specification. 
            

2.
 Where the use of the protected designation of origin  
            Prosciutto di Parma for ham marketed in slices is made subject to the condition that slicing and packaging operations be carried out in the region
            of production, this constitutes a measure having equivalent effect to a quantitative restriction on exports within the meaning
            of Article 29 EC, but may be regarded as justified, and hence compatible with that provision. 
            

3.
 However, the condition in question cannot be relied on against economic operators, as it was not brought to their attention
            by adequate publicity in Community legislation. 
            




1.
 Declares that, by laying down a general prohibition of health-related information on the labelling of foodstuffs for general
            consumption and by subjecting the display of such information to a prior authorisation procedure, the Republic of Austria
            has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 2(1)(b) and 15(1) and (2) of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December
            1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs,
            as amended by Directive 97/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997; 
            

2.
 Orders the Republic of Austria to pay the costs; 
            

3.
 Orders the Kingdom of Denmark to bear its own costs. 
            



1.
 Articles 1(4)(k) and 6(8) of Council Directive 90/496/EEC of 24 September 1990 on nutrition labelling for foodstuffs must
            be interpreted as meaning that, first, the value of a nutrient such as vitamin C which is indicated on a foodstuff following
            an analysis of the foodstuff carried out by the manufacturer may correspond to the value of that nutrient in the foodstuff
            in question at the end of its minimum conservation period and, second, that the determination of the permissible differences
            between the value stated and the value established in the course of an official check is, in the present state of Community
            law, within the competence of the Member States. 
            

2.
 Consideration of the third question has not disclosed any factor of such a kind as to affect the validity of Directive 90/496.
            
            



1.
 Article 28 EC and Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations
            of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 535/97 of 17 March 1997, do not
            preclude the application of a provision of a bilateral agreement between a Member State and a non-member country under which
            a simple and indirect indication of geographical origin from that non-member country is accorded protection in the importing
            Member State, whether or not there is any risk of consumers being misled, and the import of a product lawfully marketed in
            another Member State may be prevented. 
            

2.
 Article 28 EC precludes the application of a provision of a bilateral agreement between a Member State and a non-member country
            under which a name which in that country does not directly or indirectly refer to the geographical source of the product that
            it designates is accorded protection in the importing Member State, whether or not there is any risk of consumers being misled,
            and the import of a product lawfully marketed in another Member State may be prevented. 
            

3.
 The first paragraph of Article 307 EC is to be interpreted as permitting a court of a Member State, subject to the findings
            to be made by that court having regard inter alia to the criteria set out in this judgment, to apply the provisions of bilateral
            agreements such as those at issue in the main proceedings, concluded between that State and a non-member country and according
            protection to a name from the non-member country, even where those provisions prove to be contrary to the EC Treaty rules,
            on the ground that they concern an obligation resulting from agreements concluded before the date of the accession of the
            Member State concerned to the European Union. Pending the success of one of the methods referred to in the second paragraph
            of Article 307 EC in eliminating any incompatibilities between an agreement predating that accession and the Treaty, the first
            paragraph of that article permits that State to continue to apply such an agreement in so far as it contains obligations which
            remain binding on that State under international law.

 Declares that, by failing to adopt, within the period prescribed in the reasoned opinion, the laws, regulations and administrative
            provisions necessary to comply with Directive 1999/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 on certain
            aspects of the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has failed to fulfil its obligations
            under that directive;

It is for the national court to decide whether a contractual term such as that at issue in the main proceedings satisfies
               the requirements for it to be regarded as unfair under Article 3(1) of Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair

Article 2 of Directive 1999/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 February 1999 relating to coffee extracts
                     and chicory extracts must be interpreted as meaning that, when products mentioned in the annex to that directive are marketed,

On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby:Declares that, by failing correctly to transpose into national law Articles 5 and 6(2) of Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5
                     April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts, the Kingdom of Spain has failed to fulfil its obligations under that directive;Orders the Kingdom of Spain to pay the costs.Language of the case: Spanish.Selected version application periodVersion which is applicable todayOther sites managed by the Publications OfficePortal of the Publications Office of the EU

The European Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part,
            and the Republic of Hungary, of the other part, is not the legal basis of Council Decision 93/724/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning
            the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Hungary on the reciprocal protection and
            control of wine names.Article 133 EC, as referred to in the preamble to Decision 93/724, is an appropriate legal basis for the conclusion by the
            Community alone of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Hungary on the reciprocal protection and
            control of wine names.The prohibition of use of the name ‘Tocai’ in Italy after 31 March 2007 resulting from the exchange of letters concerning
            Article 4 of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Hungary on the reciprocal protection and control
            of wine names is not contrary to the rules governing homonyms laid down in Article 4(5) of that agreement.The Joint Declaration concerning Article 4(5) of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Hungary
            on the reciprocal protection and control of wine names, in so far as it states in the first paragraph that in respect of Article
            4(5)(a) of that agreement the Contracting Parties noted that at the time of the negotiations they were not aware of any specific
            case to which the provisions referred to could be applicable, is not a clear misrepresentation of reality.Articles 22 to 24 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, set out in Annex 1 C to the Agreement
            establishing the World Trade Organisation, approved on behalf of the Community, as regards matters within its competence,
            by Council Decision 94/800/EC of 22 December 1994, are to be interpreted as meaning that, in a case such as that in the main
            proceedings, which concerns homonymity between a geographical indication of a third country and a name including the name
            of a vine variety used for the description and presentation of certain Community wines made from it, those provisions do not
            require that that name may continue to be used in the future notwithstanding the twofold circumstance that it has been used
            in the past by the producers concerned either in good faith or for at least 10 years prior to 15 April 1994 and that it clearly
            identifies the country, region or area of origin of the protected wine in such a way as not to mislead the consumer.The right to property does not preclude the prohibition on use by the operators concerned in the autonomous region of Friuli‑Venezia
            Giulia (Italy) of the word ‘Tocai’ in the term ‘Tocai friulano’ or ‘Tocai italico’ for the description and presentation of
            certain Italian quality wines produced in specified regions at the end of a transitional period expiring on 31 March 2007,
            resulting from the exchange of letters concerning Article 4 of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic
            of Hungary on the reciprocal protection and control of wine names annexed to that agreement but not referred to in the latter.
Article 2(2)(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1139/98 of 26 May 1998 concerning the compulsory indication on the labelling
            of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms of particulars other than those provided for in Directive
            79/112/EEC, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 49/2000 of 10 January 2000, is to be interpreted as meaning that the
            exemption for which it provides from the obligation, laid down in Article 2(1) and (3) of that regulation, to state on the
            labelling of foodstuffs that material derived from certain GMOs is present, where such presence is the result of adventitious
            contamination and does not exceed a de minimis  threshold of 1% also applies to foodstuffs intended for the particular nutritional use of infants and young children.
The classification of a product as a medicinal product or as a foodstuff must take account of all the characteristics of the
            product, established both in the initial stage of the product and where it is mixed, in accordance with the method by which
            it is used, with water or with yoghurt.Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles
            and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food
            safety constitutes an additional set of rules in relation to Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
            of 10 June 2002 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements, the application of which
            is precluded to the extent to which a Community rule, such as that directive, contains specific provisions for certain categories
            of foodstuffs.Only the provisions of Community law specific to medicinal products apply to a product which satisfies equally well the conditions
            for classification as a foodstuff and the conditions for classification as a medicinal product.The pharmacological properties of a product are the factor on the basis of which the authorities of the Member States must
            ascertain, in the light of the potential capacities of the product, whether it may, for the purposes of the second subparagraph
            of Article 1(2) of Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community
            code relating to medicinal products for human use, be administered to human beings with a view to making a medical diagnosis
            or to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions in human beings. The risk that the use of a product may entail
            for health is an autonomous factor that must also be taken into consideration by the competent national authorities in the
            context of the classification of the product as a medicinal product.A product which constitutes a medicinal product within the meaning of Directive 2001/83 may be imported into another Member
            State only upon acquisition of a marketing authorisation issued in accordance with the provisions of that directive, even
            where it is lawfully marketed as a foodstuff in another Member State.The concept of ‘upper safe levels’ in Article 5(1)(a) of Directive 2002/46 is of no importance for the purposes of drawing
            a distinction between medicinal products and foodstuffs.In the context of an evaluation by a Member State of the risks that foodstuffs or food supplements may constitute for human
            health, the criterion of the existence of a nutritional need in the population of the Member State may be taken into consideration.
            However, the absence of such a need does not in itself suffice to justify, either under Article 30 EC or under Article 12
            of Directive 2002/46, a complete ban on marketing foodstuffs or food supplements lawfully manufactured or placed on the market
            in another Member State.The fact that the discretion enjoyed by the national authorities as regards the establishment of an absence of nutritional
            need is subject to only limited review by the courts is compatible with Community law, on condition that the national procedure
            for judicial review of the decisions in that regard taken by those authorities enables the court or tribunal seised of an
            application for annulment of such a decision effectively to apply the relevant principles and rules of Community law when
            reviewing its legality.Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel
            foods and novel food ingredients is to be interpreted as meaning that a food or a food ingredient has not been used for human
            consumption to a significant degree within the Community if, when all the circumstances of the case are taken into account,
            it is established that that food or that food ingredient has not been consumed in a significant quantity by humans in any
            of the Member States before the reference date. 15 May 1997 is the reference date for the purpose of determining the extent
            of human consumption of that food or food ingredient.A national court cannot refer questions on the classification of products to the European Food Safety Authority. An opinion
            delivered by that Authority, possibly in a matter forming the subject-matter of a dispute pending before a national court,
            may constitute evidence that that court should take into consideration in the context of that dispute.
Dismisses the action;Orders the Commission of the European Communities to pay the costs.

            referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs, as amended to include livestock production by Council Regulation
            (EC) No 1804/1999 of 19 July 1999 was to be interpreted as not precluding products which were not organically produced from
            bearing, in Spain, the indication ‘biológico’ or its prefix ‘bio’ in the labelling, advertising material and commercial documents;That same Article 2, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 392/2004 of 24 February 2004, must be interpreted as precluding
            from now on such products from bearing, in Spain, the indication ‘biológico’ or its prefix ‘bio’ in the labelling, advertising
            material and commercial documents.
Article 10(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1538/91 of 5 June 1991 introducing detailed rules for implementing Council
            Regulation (EEC) No 1906/90 on certain marketing standards for poultrymeat, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1321/2002
            of 22 July 2002, must be interpreted as meaning that the wording ‘reared under controlled conditions’ (‘kontrollierte Aufzucht’)
            constitutes an indication of the type of farming and for that reason that article does not allow an undertaking to include
            that wording on the labelling of a product falling within the scope of that regulation.
Dismisses the actions;Orders the Federal Republic of Germany to pay the costs in relation to Case C-465/02 and the Kingdom of Denmark to pay the
            costs in relation to Case C‑466/02;Orders the Hellenic Republic, the French Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to bear their
            own costs.
Article 3(2)(a) of Council Directive 85/577/EEC of 20 December 1985 to protect the consumer in respect of contracts negotiated
            away from business premises must be interpreted as excluding from the scope of the Directive contracts for the sale of immovable
            property even where they are merely a component of an investment scheme financed by a loan for which the negotiations prior
            to the conclusion of the contract were held in a doorstep-selling situation, both as regards the contract for the purchase
            of the immovable property and the loan agreement serving solely to finance that purchase.Directive 85/577 does not preclude national rules which limit the effect of cancellation of the loan agreement to the avoidance
            of that agreement, even in the case of investment schemes in which the loan would not have been granted at all without the
            acquisition of the immovable property.Directive 85/577 does not preclude:a requirement that a consumer who has exercised his right to cancel under the Directive must pay back the loan proceeds to
            the lender, even though according to the scheme drawn up for the investment the loan serves solely to finance the purchase
            of the immovable property and is paid directly to the vendor thereof;a requirement that the amount of the loan must be paid back immediately;national legislation which provides for an obligation on the consumer, in the event of cancellation of a secured credit agreement,
            not only to repay the amounts received under the agreement but also to pay to the lender interest at the market rate. However, in a situation where, if the Bank had complied with it obligation to inform the consumer of his right of cancellation,
            the consumer would have been able to avoid exposure to the risks inherent in investments such as those at issue in the main
            proceedings, Article 4 of Directive 85/577 requires Member States to ensure that their legislation protects consumers who
            have been unable to avoid exposure to such risks, by adopting suitable measures to allow them to avoid bearing the consequences
            of the materialisation of those risks. 
Articles 1 and 2 of Council Directive 85/577/EEC of 20 December 1985 to protect the consumer in respect of contracts negotiated
            away from business premises must be interpreted as meaning that when a third party intervenes in the name of or on behalf
            of a trader in the negotiation or conclusion of a contract, the application of the Directive cannot be made subject to the
            condition that the trader was or should have been aware that the contract was concluded in a doorstep‑selling situation as
            referred to in Article 1 of the Directive. Directive 85/577, and Article 5(2) thereof in particular, does not preclude:a requirement that a consumer who has exercised his right to cancel under the Directive must pay back the loan proceeds to
            the lender, even though according to the scheme drawn up for the investment the loan serves solely to finance the purchase
            of the immovable property and is paid directly to the vendor thereof;a requirement that the amount of the loan must be paid back immediately;national legislation which provides for an obligation on the consumer, in the event of cancellation of a secured credit agreement,
            not only to repay the amounts received under the agreement but also to pay to the lender interest at the market rate;However, in a situation where, if the Bank had complied with its obligation to inform the consumer of his right of cancellation,
            the consumer would have been able to avoid exposure to the risks inherent in investments such as those at issue in the main
            proceedings, Article 4 of the Directive requires Member States to ensure that their legislation protects consumers who have
            been unable to avoid exposure to such risks, by adopting suitable measures to allow them to avoid bearing the consequences
            of the materialisation of those risks. 
Declares that, by failing to comply with the obligations to verify the compliance of cost accounting systems by a competent
            independent body and to publish a statement of compliance for the years 1998 and 1999, in accordance with Article 7(5) of
            Directive 97/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1997 on interconnection in telecommunications
            with regard to ensuring universal service and interoperability through application of the principles of Open Network Provision
            (ONP) and by failing to apply correctly in practice the measures relating to the verification of the compliance of the cost
            accounting system by the national regulatory authority or another competent body, independent of the telecommunications organisation
            and approved by that regulatory authority, for the year 2000, in accordance with the provisions of Article 18(1) and (2) of
            Directive 98/10/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 1998 on the application of open network provision
            (ONP) to voice telephony and on universal service for telecommunications in a competitive environment, as maintained by Article
            27 of Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework
            for electronic communications networks and services (‘the Framework Directive’), read in conjunction with Article 16 of Directive
            2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users’ rights relating to
            electronic communications networks and services (‘the Universal Service Directive’), the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has failed
            to fulfil its obligations under those provisions;Orders the Commission of the European Communities and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to bear their own costs.
Article 3a(1)(g) of Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 concerning misleading and comparative advertising, as
            amended by Directive 97/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 October 1997, must be interpreted as meaning
            that, in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, by using in its catalogues the core element of a manufacturer’s
            distinguishing mark which is known in specialist circles, a competing supplier does not take unfair advantage of the reputation
            of that distinguishing mark.
Declares that, by continuing to regard the supplier of a defective product as liable on the same basis as the producer where
            the producer cannot be identified, even though the supplier has informed the injured person within a reasonable time of the
            identity of the person who supplied him with the product, the French Republic has failed to take the necessary measures to
            comply fully with the judgment in Case C‑52/00 Commission v France as regards the transposition of Article 3(3) of Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the
            laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products, and has
            thereby failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 228 EC;Orders the French Republic to pay to the Commission of the European Communities, into the ‘European Community own resources’
            account, a penalty payment of EUR 31 650 for each day of delay in taking the necessary measures to comply fully with the judgment
            in Case C‑52/00 Commission v France from delivery of the present judgment until full compliance with the judgment in that case;Orders the French Republic to pay the costs.

Pricing for interconnection related to the provision of number portability, as referred to in Article 30(2) of Directive 2002/22/EC
            of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic
            communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive), concerns the traffic costs of numbers ported and the set-up
            costs incurred by mobile telephone operators to implement requests for number porting.Article 30(2) of Directive 2002/22 does not preclude the adoption of a national measure laying down the specific method to
            be used in calculating costs and which fixes in advance and on the basis of an abstract model of the costs maximum prices
            which may be charged by the donor operator to the recipient operator as set-up costs, provided that the prices are fixed on
            the basis of the costs in such a way that consumers are not dissuaded from making use of the facility of portability. Article 4 of Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework
            for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive) must be interpreted as meaning that the body responsible
            for hearing an appeal against a decision of the national regulatory authority must have at its disposal all the information
            necessary in order to decide on the merits of the appeal, including, if necessary, confidential information which that authority
            has taken into account in reaching the decision which is the subject of the appeal.  However, that body must guarantee the
            confidentiality of the information in question whilst complying with the requirements of effective legal protection and ensuring
            protection of the rights of defence of the parties to the dispute. 
The condition under which comparative advertising is permissible that is laid down by Article 3a(1)(b) of Council Directive
            84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 concerning misleading and comparative advertising, as amended by Directive 97/55/EC of the
            European Parliament and of the Council of 6 October 1997, must be interpreted as not precluding comparative advertising from
            relating collectively to selections of basic consumables sold by two competing chains of stores in so far as those selections
            each consist of individual products which, when viewed in pairs, individually satisfy the requirement of comparability laid
            down by that provision.Article 3a(1)(c) of Directive 84/450, as amended by Directive 97/55, must be interpreted as meaning that the requirement,
            laid down by that provision, that the advertising ‘objectively compares’ the features of the goods at issue does not signify,
            in the event of comparison of the prices of a selection of comparable basic consumables sold by competing chains of stores
            or of the general level of the prices charged by them in respect of the range of comparable products which they sell, that
            the products and prices compared, that is to say both those of the advertiser and those of all of his competitors involved
            in the comparison, must be expressly and exhaustively listed in the advertisement.Article 3a(1)(c) of Directive 84/450, as amended by Directive 97/55, must be interpreted as meaning that the following constitute,
            for the purposes of that provision, ‘verifiable’ features of goods sold by two competing chains of stores:–      the prices of those goods;the general level of the respective prices charged by such chains of stores in respect of their selection of comparable products
            and the amount liable to be saved by consumers who purchase such products from one rather than the other of those chains,
            in so far as the goods in question do in fact form part of the selection of comparable products on whose basis that general
            price level has been determined.Article 3a(1)(c) of Directive 84/450, as amended by Directive 97/55, must be interpreted as meaning that a feature mentioned
            in comparative advertising satisfies the requirement of verifiability laid down by that provision, in cases where the details
            of the comparison which form the basis for the mention of that feature are not set out in the advertising, only if the advertiser
            indicates, in particular for the attention of the persons to whom the advertisement is addressed, where and how they may readily
            examine those details with a view to verifying, or, if they do not possess the skill required for that purpose, to having
            verified, the details and the feature in question as to their accuracy.Article 3a(1)(a) of Directive 84/450, as amended by Directive 97/55, must be interpreted as meaning that comparative advertising
            claiming that the advertiser’s general price level is lower than his main competitors’, where the comparison has related to
            a sample of products, may be misleading when the advertisement:–      does not reveal that the comparison related only to such a sample and not to all the advertiser’s products,–      does not identify the details of the comparison made or inform the persons to whom it is addressed of the information source
            where such identification is possible, or–      contains a collective reference to a range of amounts that may be saved by consumers who make their purchases from the advertiser
            rather than from his competitors without specifying individually the general level of the prices charged, respectively, by
            each of those competitors and the amount that consumers are liable to save by making their purchases from the advertiser rather
            than from each of the competitors.
Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of
            the Member States concerning liability for defective products must be interpreted as:precluding a national rule under which the supplier is answerable, beyond the cases listed exhaustively in Article 3(3) of
            the directive, for the no-fault liability which the directive establishes and imposes on the producer;not precluding a national rule under which the supplier is answerable without restriction for the producer’s fault-based liability.
Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts must be interpreted as meaning that a national
            court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award must determine whether the arbitration agreement is void and
            annul that award where that agreement contains an unfair term, even though the consumer has not pleaded that invalidity in
            the course of the arbitration proceedings, but only in that of the action for annulment.
Articles 2, 3 and 12 of Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation
            of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs are to be interpreted
            as not precluding legislation of a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which makes it possible for
            an operator, established in that Member State, which distributes a pre-packaged alcoholic beverage to be delivered as such
            within the meaning of Article 1 of that directive, produced by an operator established in another Member State, to be held
            liable for an infringement of that provision, established by a public authority, resulting from the producer’s inaccurate
            statement on the product label of the alcoholic strength by volume of the product and, consequently, to be penalised by an
            administrative fine, even where, as the mere distributor, it simply markets the product as delivered to it by the producer.

Article 11 of Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative
            provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products, is to be interpreted as meaning that a product
            is put into circulation when it is taken out of the manufacturing process operated by the producer and enters a marketing
            process in the form in which it is offered to the public in order to be used or consumed.When an action is brought against a company mistakenly considered to be the producer of a product whereas, in reality, it
            was manufactured by another company, it is as a rule for national law to determine the conditions in accordance with which
            one party may be substituted for another in the context of such an action. A national court examining the conditions governing
            such a substitution must, however, ensure that due regard is had to the personal scope of Directive 85/374, as established
            by Articles 1 and 3 thereof.
Article 2(2a) of Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 concerning misleading and comparative advertising, as amended
            by Directive 97/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 October 1997, is to be interpreted as meaning that
            a reference in an advertisement to a type of product and not to a specific undertaking or product can be considered to be
            comparative advertising where it is possible to identify that undertaking or the goods that it offers as being actually referred
            to by the advertisement. The fact that a number of the advertiser’s competitors or the goods or services that they offer may
            be identified as being in fact referred to by the advertisement is of no relevance for the purpose of recognising the comparative
            nature of the advertising.The existence of a competitive relationship between the advertiser and the undertaking identified in the advertisement cannot
            be established independently of the goods or services offered by that undertaking.In order to determine whether there is a competitive relationship between the advertiser and the undertaking identified in
            the advertisement, it is necessary to consider:–      the current state of the market and consumer habits and how they might evolve,–      the part of the Community territory in which the advertising is disseminated, without, however, excluding, where appropriate,
            the effects which the evolution of consumer habits seen in other Member States may have on the national market at issue, and–      the particular characteristics of the product which the advertiser seeks to promote and the image which it wishes to impart
            to it.The criteria for establishing the existence of a competitive relationship within the meaning of Article 2(2a) of Directive
            84/450, as amended by Directive 97/55, are not identical to those for determining whether the comparison fulfils the condition
            in Article 3a(1)(b) of the same directive. Advertising which refers to a type of product without thereby identifying a competitor or the goods which it offers is not
            impermissible with regard to Article 3a(1) of Directive 84/450, as amended by Directive 97/55. The conditions governing whether
            such advertising is permissible must be assessed in the light of other provisions of national law or, where appropriate, of
            Community law, irrespective of the fact that that could mean a lower level of protection for consumers or competing undertakings.Article 3a(1)(f) of Directive 84/450, as amended by Directive 97/55, must be interpreted as meaning that, for products without
            designation of origin, any comparison which relates to products with designation of origin is not impermissible.

On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:1. Articles 11 and 14 of Council Directive 87/102/EEC of 22 December 1986 for the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning consumer credit, as amended by Directive 98/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998, must be interpreted as meaning that the right to pursue remedies, provided for in Article 11(2) of Directive 87/102, as amended, which the consumer enjoys against the grantor of credit, may not be made subject to the condition that the prior offer of credit must indicate the goods or services being financed. 2. Directive 87/102, as amended by Directive 98/7, must be interpreted as allowing national courts to apply of their own motion the provisions transposing Article 11(2) of Directive 87/102 into national law. 
The first paragraph of Article 27 of Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on
            a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive) and Article 16(1)(a)
            of Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users’ rights
            relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive) must be interpreted as meaning that
            a statutory requirement for the approval of tariffs for the supply of retail voice telephony services provided by undertakings
            with a dominant position in that market, such as that provided for in Paragraph 25 of the Law on Telecommunications (Telekommunikationsgesetz)
            of 25 July 1996, enacted by national law and preceding the regulatory framework resulting from those directives, together
            with administrative measures confirming that requirement, must be temporarily maintained.
Dismisses the action;Orders the Commission of the European Communities to pay the costs;Orders the Czech Republic, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Italian Republic and the Republic of Austria to bear their own costs.
Council Directive 85/577/EEC of 20 December 1985 to protect the consumer in respect of contracts negotiated away from business
            premises must be interpreted as meaning that the national legislature is entitled to provide that the right of cancellation
            laid down in Article 5(1) of the directive may be exercised no later than one month from the time at which the contracting
            parties have performed in full their obligations under a contract for long-term credit, where the consumer has been given
            defective notice concerning the exercise of that right.
Article 5(1) and (2) of First Council Directive 89/104/EEC of 21 December 1988 to approximate the laws of the Member States
            relating to trade marks and Article 3a(1) of Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 concerning misleading and comparative
            advertising, as amended by Directive 97/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 October 1997, must be interpreted
            to the effect that the proprietor of a registered trade mark is not entitled to prevent the use by a third party of a sign
            identical with, or similar to, his mark, in a comparative advertisement which satisfies all the conditions, laid down in Article
            3a(1) of Directive 84/450, under which comparative advertising is permitted.However, where the conditions required in Article 5(1)(b) of Directive 89/104 to prevent the use of a sign identical with,
            or similar to, a registered trade mark are met, a comparative advertisement in which that sign is used cannot satisfy the
            condition, laid down in Article 3a(1)(d) of Directive 84/450, as amended by Directive 97/55, under which comparative advertising
            is permitted.  Article 5(1)(b) of Directive 89/104 is to be interpreted as meaning that the proprietor of a registered trade mark is not
            entitled to prevent the use by a third party, in a comparative advertisement, of a sign similar to that mark in relation to
            goods or services identical with, or similar to, those for which that mark was registered where such use does not give rise
            to a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, and that is so irrespective of whether or not the comparative advertisement
            satisfies all the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 84/450, as amended by Directive 97/55, under which comparative
            advertising is permitted.

                     call number ‘112’, the Slovak Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 26(3) of Directive 2002/22/EC of
                     the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications
                     networks and services (Universal Service Directive);

	Declares that by not making, for calls to the single European emergency call number ‘112’, caller location information available
                     to authorities handling emergencies, to the extent technically feasible, the Kingdom of the Netherlands has failed to fulfil
                     its obligations under Article 26(3) of Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002

                     to authorities handling emergencies, to the extent technically feasible, the Kingdom of the Netherlands has failed to fulfil
                     its obligations under Article 26(3) of Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002

Article 29 EC does not preclude national rules which prohibit a supplier, in cross-border distance selling, from requiring
            an advance or any payment from a consumer before expiry of the withdrawal period, but Article 29 EC does preclude a prohibition,
            under those rules, on requesting, before expiry of that period, the number of the consumer’s payment card.
Article 31(1) of Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and
            users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive) is to be interpreted
            as meaning that it does not preclude national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which requires a
            cable operator to provide access to its analogue cable network to television channels and services that are already being
            broadcast terrestrially, thereby resulting in the utilisation of more than half of the channels available on that network,
            and which provides, in the event of a shortage of available channels, for an order of priority of applicants which results
            in full utilisation of the channels available on that network, provided that those obligations do not give rise to unreasonable
            economic consequences, which is a matter for the national court to establish. The concept of ‘television services’ within the meaning of Article 31(1) of Directive 2002/22 includes services of broadcasters
            of television programmes or providers of media services, such as teleshopping, provided that the conditions laid down in that
            provision are met, which is a matter for the national court to establish.
On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:Article 28 EC does not preclude national rules, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, which prohibit the sale and transfer by mail order of image storage media which have not been examined and classified by a higher regional authority or a national voluntary self-regulation body for the purposes of protecting young persons and which do not bear a label from that authority or that body indicating the age from which they may be viewed, unless it appears that the procedure for examination, classification and labelling of image storage media established by those rules is not readily accessible or cannot be completed within a reasonable period, or that a decision of refusal is not open to challenge before the courts.

                     available, to the extent technically feasible, to the authorities handling emergencies, the Italian Republic has failed to
                     fulfil its obligations under Article 26(3) of Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March
                     2002 on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service

                     and at least one comprehensive telephone directory enquiry service in accordance with the provisions of Articles 5(1) and
                     (2) and 25(1) and (3) of Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service
                     and users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive), the Portuguese
                     Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under that directive.
                  



1.	Declares that, by not guaranteeing, in practice, the making available to all end-users of at least one comprehensive directory

Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial
            practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of
            the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council
            (‘Unfair Commercial Practices Directive’) must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in
            the disputes in the main proceedings, which, with certain exceptions, and without taking account of the specific circumstances,
            imposes a general prohibition of combined offers made by a vendor to a consumer. 
On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:Article 11(2) of Council Directive 87/102/EEC of 22 December 1986 for the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning consumer credit is to be interpreted as meaning that, in a situation such as that in the main proceedings, an agreement between a supplier and a grantor of credit whereunder credit is made available exclusively by that grantor of credit to customers of that supplier is not a necessary condition for the right of those customers to pursue remedies against the grantor of credit – where the supplier is in breach of contract – in order to obtain the termination of the credit agreement and the subsequent reimbursement of the sums already paid to the grantor of credit. 
The Court:

	Declares that by failing to adopt, within the prescribed period, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary
                     to comply with Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer
                     commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC
                     of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council

On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products must be interpreted to mean that it does not preclude the interpretation of domestic law or the application of settled domestic case-law according to which an injured person can seek compensation for damage to an item of property intended for professional use and employed for that purpose, where that injured person simply proves the damage, the defect in the product and the causal link between that defect and the damage. 
Article 5(2) of First Council Directive 89/104/EEC of 21 December 1988 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating
            to trade marks must be interpreted as meaning that the taking of unfair advantage of the distinctive character or the repute
            of a mark, within the meaning of that provision, does not require that there be a likelihood of confusion or a likelihood
            of detriment to the distinctive character or the repute of the mark or, more generally, to its proprietor. The advantage arising
            from the use by a third party of a sign similar to a mark with a reputation is an advantage taken unfairly by that third party
            of the distinctive character or the repute of that mark where that party seeks by that use to ride on the coat-tails of the
            mark with a reputation in order to benefit from the power of attraction, the reputation and the prestige of that mark and
            to exploit, without paying any financial compensation, the marketing effort expended by the proprietor of the mark in order
            to create and maintain the mark’s image.Article 5(1)(a) of Directive 89/104 must be interpreted as meaning that the proprietor of a registered trade mark is entitled
            to prevent the use by a third party, in a comparative advertisement which does not satisfy all the conditions, laid down in
            Article 3a(1) of Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 concerning misleading and comparative advertising, as amended
            by Directive 97/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 October 1997, under which comparative advertising
            is permitted, of a sign identical with that mark in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which
            that mark was registered, even where such use is not capable of jeopardising the essential function of the mark, which is
            to indicate the origin of the goods or services, provided that such use affects or is liable to affect one of the other functions
            of the mark. Article 3a(1) of Directive 84/450, as amended by Directive 97/55, must be interpreted as meaning that an advertiser who states
            explicitly or implicitly in comparative advertising that the product marketed by him is an imitation of a product bearing
            a well-known trade mark presents ‘goods or services as imitations or replicas’ within the meaning of Article 3a(1)(h). The
            advantage gained by the advertiser as a result of such unlawful comparative advertising must be considered to be an advantage
            taken unfairly of the reputation of that mark within the meaning of Article 3a(1)(g).  
Consideration of the first question asked by the referring court has not disclosed any factor liable to affect the validity
            of Council Regulation (EC) No 1347/2001 of 28 June 2001 supplementing the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1107/96 on
            the registration of geographical indications and designations of origin under the procedure laid down in Article 17 of Council
            Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92.Regulation No 1347/2001 must be interpreted as having no adverse effects on the validity and the possibility of using, in
            one of the situations referred to in Article 13 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of
            geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs, pre‑existing trade marks of
            third parties in which the word ‘Bavaria’ appears and which were registered in good faith before the date on which the application
            for registration of the protected geographical indication ‘Bayerisches Bier’ was lodged, provided that those marks are not
            affected by the grounds for invalidity or revocation as provided for by Article 3(1)(c) and (g) and Article 12(2)(b) of First
            Council Directive 89/104/EEC of 21 December 1988 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks.
The provisions of the second sentence of Article 6(1) and Article 6(2) of Directive 97/7/EC of the European Parliament and
            of the Council of 20 May 1997 on the protection of consumers in respect of distance contracts must be interpreted as precluding
            a provision of national law which provides in general that, in the case of withdrawal by a consumer within the withdrawal
            period, a seller may claim compensation for the value of the use of the consumer goods acquired under a distance contract.However, those provisions do not prevent the consumer from being required to pay compensation for the use of the goods in
            the case where he has made use of those goods in a manner incompatible with the principles of civil law, such as those of
            good faith or unjust enrichment, on condition that the purpose of that directive and, in particular, the efficiency and effectiveness
            of the right of withdrawal are not adversely affected, this being a matter for the national court to determine.
It follows from paragraph 101 of the judgment of 18 November 2003 in Case C‑216/01 Budĕjovický Budvar that:in order to determine whether a designation can be considered to constitute a simple and indirect indication of geographical
            provenance, protection of which under the bilateral instruments at issue is capable of being justified on the basis of the
            criteria laid down in Article 30 EC, the national court must ascertain whether, according to factual circumstances and perceptions
            prevailing in the Czech Republic, that designation, even if it is not in itself a geographical name, is at least capable of
            informing the consumer that the product bearing that indication comes from a particular place or region of that Member State;the national court must, in addition, ascertain, once again in the light of factual circumstances and perceptions prevailing
            in the Czech Republic, whether, as stated in paragraph 99 of that judgment, the designation at issue in the main proceedings
            has not, either at the time of the entry into force of the bilateral instruments at issue in the main proceedings or subsequently,
            become generic in that Member State, the Court of Justice of the European Communities having already held, in paragraphs 99
            and 100 of that judgment, that the aim of the system of protection introduced by those instruments falls within the sphere
            of the protection of industrial and commercial property within the meaning of Article 30 EC; in the absence of any Community provision in that regard, it is for the national court to decide, in accordance with its own
            national law, whether a consumer survey should be commissioned for the purpose of clarifying the factual circumstances and
            perceptions prevailing in the Czech Republic in order to ascertain whether the designation ‘Bud’ at issue in the main proceedings
            can be classified as a simple and indirect indication of geographical provenance and has not become generic in that Member
            State. It is also in the light of that national law that the national court, if it finds it necessary to commission a consumer
            survey, must determine, for the purposes of making the necessary assessments, the percentage of consumers that would be sufficiently
            significant; andArticle 30 EC does not lay down specific requirements as to the quality and the duration of the use made of a designation
            in the Member State of origin for its protection to be justified in the light of that article. Whether such requirements apply
            in the context of the dispute in the main proceedings must be determined by the national court in the light of the applicable
            national law, in particular the system of protection laid down by the bilateral instruments at issue in the main proceedings.The Community system of protection laid down by Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20 March 2006 on the protection of
            geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs is exhaustive in nature, with
            the result that that regulation precludes the application of a system of protection laid down by agreements between two Member
            States, such as the bilateral instruments at issue in the main proceedings, which confers on a designation, which is recognised
            under the law of a Member State as constituting a designation of origin, protection in another Member State where that protection
            is actually claimed, despite the fact that no application for registration of that designation of origin has been made in
            accordance with that regulation.
