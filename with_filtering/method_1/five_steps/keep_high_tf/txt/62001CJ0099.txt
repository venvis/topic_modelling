On those grounds,
THE COURT (Sixth Chamber),
in answer to the questions referred to it by the Verwaltungsgerichtshof by order of 29 January 2001, hereby rules:
1. Article 6(3) of Council Directive 76/768/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products, as amended by Council Directive 93/35/EEC of 14 June 1993, precludes national legislation which prohibits reference to expert medical opinions in the marketing of cosmetic products - in particular, the use of the statement dermatologically tested' - if that reference does not include information relating to the contents and outcome of those assessments.
2. Article 6(3) of Directive 76/768 as amended by Directive 93/35 precludes national legislation which authorises the use of information as referred to in Question 1 only on condition that prior authorisation is granted by the competent Minister.
