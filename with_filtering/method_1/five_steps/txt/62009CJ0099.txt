Article 30(2) of Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and
            usersâ€™ rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive) is to be interpreted
            as obliging the national regulatory authority to take account of the costs incurred by mobile telephone network operators
            in implementing the number portability service when it assesses whether the direct charge to subscribers for the use of that
            service is a disincentive. However, it retains the power to fix the maximum amount of that charge levied by operators at a
            level below the costs incurred by them, when a charge calculated only on the basis of those costs is liable to dissuade users
            from making use of the portability facility.
