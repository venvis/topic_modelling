On those grounds,
THE COURT (Fifth Chamber)
hereby:
1. Declares that, by failing to adopt the measures necessary to transpose in full Article 7(3) of Council Directive 93/13/CEE of 5 December 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts, the Italian Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under the Directive;
2. Orders the Italian Republic to pay the costs.
