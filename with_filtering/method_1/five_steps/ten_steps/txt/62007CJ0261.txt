Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial
            practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of
            the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council
            (‘Unfair Commercial Practices Directive’) must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in
            the disputes in the main proceedings, which, with certain exceptions, and without taking account of the specific circumstances,
            imposes a general prohibition of combined offers made by a vendor to a consumer.
