 As regards the period prior to the entry into force of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1107/96 of 12 June 1996 on the registration
            of geographical indications and designations of origin under the procedure laid down in Article 17 of Council Regulation (EEC)
            No 2081/92, Article 29 EC must be interpreted as not precluding a convention concluded between two Member States A and B,
            such as the Convention between the French Republic and the Italian Republic on the protection of designations of origin, indications
            of provenance and names of certain products, signed in Rome on 28 April 1964, from making applicable in Member State A national
            legislation of Member State B, such as that referred to by the national court, under which the designation of origin of a
            cheese, protected in Member State B, is reserved, for cheese marketed in grated form, to cheese grated and packaged in the
            region of production. 
            

2.
 Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin
            for agricultural products and foodstuffs, as amended by the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of
            Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden and the adjustments to the Treaties on which the European Union
            is founded, must be interpreted as not precluding the use of a protected designation of origin from being subject to the condition
            that operations such as the grating and packaging of the product take place in the region of production, where such a condition
            is laid down in the specification. 
            

3.
 Where the use of the protected designation of origin  
            Grana Padano for cheese marketed in grated form is made subject to the condition that grating and packaging operations be carried out
            in the region of production, this constitutes a measure having equivalent effect to a quantitative restriction on exports
            within the meaning of Article 29 EC, but may be regarded as justified, and hence compatible with that provision. 
            

4.
 However, the condition in question may not be relied on against economic operators, as it was not brought to their knowledge
            by adequate publicity in Community legislation. Nevertheless, the principle of legal certainty does not preclude that condition
            from being regarded by the national court as capable of being relied on against operators who carried on the activity of grating
            and packaging the product in the period prior to the entry into force of Regulation No 1107/96, should that court consider
            that during that period the Decree of 4 November 1991 was applicable by virtue of the aforesaid Convention between the French
            Republic and the Italian Republic and capable of being relied on against those concerned by virtue of the national rules on
            publicity.
