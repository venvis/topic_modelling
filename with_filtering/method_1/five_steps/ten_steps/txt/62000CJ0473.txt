On those grounds, 
THE COURT 
(Fifth Chamber), 
in answer to the question referred to it by the Tribunal d'instance de Vienne by judgment of 15 December 2000, rectified by judgment of 26 January 2001, hereby rules: 
Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts precludes a national provision which, in proceedings brought by a seller or supplier against a consumer on the basis of a contract concluded between them, prohibits the national court, on expiry of a limitation period, from finding, of its own motion or following a plea raised by the consumer, that a term of the contract is unfair.
