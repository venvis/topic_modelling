Article 10(2)(a), (c) and (e) of Directive 2008/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 on credit agreements for consumers and repealing Council Directive 87/102/EEC must be interpreted as meaning that, where the situation arises, a credit agreement must state in a clear and concise manner that it is a ‘linked credit agreement’ within the meaning of Article 3(n) of that directive and that the agreement is concluded for a fixed term.
Article 10(2) of Directive 2008/48 must be interpreted as meaning that it does not require a ‘linked credit agreement’ within the meaning of Article 3(n) of that directive, which serves exclusively to finance an agreement for the supply of goods and stipulates that the credit amount is to be paid to the seller of those goods, to state that the consumer is released from his or her obligation to pay the sale price to the extent of the amount disbursed and that the seller is required to deliver the purchased goods to the consumer if the sale price has been paid in full.
Article 10(2)(l) of Directive 2008/48 must be interpreted as meaning that a credit agreement must state, in the form of a specific percentage, the rate of late-payment interest applicable at the time of conclusion of that agreement and must explain the specific arrangements for adjusting the rate of late-payment interest. Where the parties to the credit agreement concerned have agreed that the rate of late-payment interest is to change in step with a change in the base rate set by the central bank of a Member State and published in an easy-to-access official journal, a reference in that agreement to that base rate is sufficient, provided that the method of calculating the rate of late-payment interest relative to the base rate is set out in the credit agreement. In that regard, two conditions must be met. In the first place, that method of calculation must be set out in a way which is readily understood by an average consumer who does not have specialist knowledge in the financial field and must enable him or her to calculate the rate of late-payment interest based on the information provided in the credit agreement. In the second place, the frequency with which the base rate may be varied, which is determined by national provisions, must also be set out in the credit agreement concerned.
Article 10(2)(r) of Directive 2008/48 must interpreted as meaning that a credit agreement must, for the purpose of calculating the compensation payable in the event of early repayment of the loan, state the specific method for calculating that compensation in a way which is readily understood by an average consumer, so that he or she can ascertain the amount of compensation payable in the event of early repayment based on the information provided in the credit agreement.
Article 10(2) of Directive 2008/48 must be interpreted as meaning that it does not require a credit agreement to set out all the situations in which the parties to the agreement enjoy a right of termination not under that directive, but under national legislation alone.
Article 14(1) of Directive 2008/48 must be interpreted as precluding a creditor from relying on a time bar when a consumer exercises his or her right of withdrawal under that provision, in circumstances where some of the mandatory information listed in Article 10(2) of that directive was not included in the credit agreement and was also not duly communicated at a later stage, irrespective of whether the consumer was unaware of the existence of his or her right of withdrawal and was not responsible for that lack of knowledge.
Directive 2008/48 must be interpreted as precluding a creditor from legitimately claiming that a consumer has abused his or her right of withdrawal, laid down in Article 14(1) of that directive, where some of the mandatory information listed in Article 10(2) thereof was not included in the credit agreement and was also not duly communicated at a later stage, irrespective of whether the consumer was unaware of the existence of his or her right of withdrawal.
Article 10(2)(t) of Directive 2008/48 must be interpreted as meaning that a credit agreement must specify the essential information relating to all out-of-court complaint or redress mechanisms available to the consumer and, where appropriate, the costs of using them; that the complaint or application for redress must be submitted by post or electronically; the physical or electronic address to which that complaint or application for redress should be sent; and the other formal requirements to be satisfied by that complaint or application for redress. As regards that information, a mere reference, in the credit agreement, to rules of procedure available on the internet or to another act or document concerning the detailed rules governing out-of-court complaint and redress mechanisms is insufficient.
