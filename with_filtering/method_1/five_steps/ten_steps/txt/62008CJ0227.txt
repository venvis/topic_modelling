Article 4 of Council DirectiveÂ 85/577/EEC of 20 December 1985 to protect the consumer in respect of contracts negotiated away
            from business premises does not preclude a national court from declaring, of its own motion, that a contract falling within
            the scope of that directive is void on the ground that the consumer was not informed of his right of cancellation, even though
            the consumer at no stage pleaded that the contract was void before the competent national courts.
