On those grounds,
THE COURT 
(First Chamber), 
in answer to the question referred to it by the Corte Suprema di Cassazione by order of 4 December 1995, hereby rules: 
Article 3(1)(6) of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer is to be interpreted as meaning that the expression `established within the Community' used in it refers only to the seller.
