Article 31(1) of Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and
            users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive) is to be interpreted
            as meaning that it does not preclude national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which requires a
            cable operator to provide access to its analogue cable network to television channels and services that are already being
            broadcast terrestrially, thereby resulting in the utilisation of more than half of the channels available on that network,
            and which provides, in the event of a shortage of available channels, for an order of priority of applicants which results
            in full utilisation of the channels available on that network, provided that those obligations do not give rise to unreasonable
            economic consequences, which is a matter for the national court to establish. 
The concept of ‘television services’ within the meaning of Article 31(1) of Directive 2002/22 includes services of broadcasters
            of television programmes or providers of media services, such as teleshopping, provided that the conditions laid down in that
            provision are met, which is a matter for the national court to establish.
