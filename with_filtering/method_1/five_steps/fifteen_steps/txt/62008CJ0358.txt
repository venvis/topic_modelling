Article 11 of Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative
            provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products must be interpreted as precluding national legislation,
            which allows the substitution of one defendant for another during proceedings, from being applied in a way which permits a
            ‘producer’, within the meaning of Article 3 of that directive, to be sued, after the expiry of the period prescribed by that
            article, as defendant in proceedings brought within that period against another person.
However, first, Article 11 must be interpreted as not precluding a national court from holding that, in the proceedings instituted
            within the period prescribed by that article against the wholly-owned subsidiary of the ‘producer’, within the meaning of
            Article 3(1) of Directive 85/374, that producer can be substituted for that subsidiary if that court finds that the putting
            into circulation of the product in question was, in fact, determined by that producer.
Second, Article 3(3) of Directive 85/374 must be interpreted as meaning that, where the person injured by an allegedly defective
            product was not reasonably able to identify the producer of that product before exercising his rights against the supplier
            of that product, that supplier must be treated as a ‘producer’ for the purposes, in particular, of the application of Article
            11 of that directive, if it did not inform the injured person, on its own initiative and promptly, of the identity of the
            producer or its own supplier. That is for the national court to determine in the light of the circumstances of the case.
