Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic
            communications networks and services (Framework Directive) and Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the
            Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks and services
            (Universal Service Directive) must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation, such as Article 57(1)(1) of the
            Polish Law on Telecommunications (ustawa – Prawo telekomunikacyjne) of 16 July 2004, in the version applicable to the facts
            in the main proceedings, which prohibits making the conclusion of a contract for the provision of services contingent on the
            conclusion, by the end‑user, of a contract for the provision of other services.
However, Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business‑to‑consumer
            commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC
            of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council
            (‘Unfair Commercial Practices Directive’) must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which, with certain exceptions,
            and without taking account of the specific circumstances, imposes a general prohibition of combined offers made by a vendor
            to a consumer.
