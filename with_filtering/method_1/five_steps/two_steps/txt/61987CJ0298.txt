On those grounds  
THE COURT ( Third Chamber )  
in reply to the question referred to it for a preliminary ruling by the tribunal de commerce, L' Aigle, by judgment of 15 June 1987, as supplemented by a judgment of 21 September 1987, hereby rules :  
( 1 ) Article 30 of the Treaty precludes a Member State from applying to products imported from another Member State, where they are lawfully manufactured and marketed, national rules which reserve the right to use the name "yoghurt" solely to fresh yoghurt, to the exclusion of deep-frozen yoghurt, when the characteristics of the latter product are not substantially different from those of the fresh product, and when appropriate labelling, together with an indication of the date by which the product should be sold or consumed, is sufficient to ensure that consumers are properly informed .  
( 2 ) The provisions of Directive 79/112/EEC, in particular Article 5, must be interpreted as precluding the application of national rules which refuse to allow imported or domestic products which have been deep-frozen to bear the name "yoghurt", where those products, for the rest, comply with the requirements laid down by the national rules for fresh products to bear that name .
