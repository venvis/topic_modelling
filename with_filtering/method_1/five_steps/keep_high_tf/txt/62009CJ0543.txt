Article 25(2) of Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and
            usersâ€™ rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive) must be interpreted
            as not precluding national legislation under which undertakings assigning telephone numbers to end-users must make available
            to undertakings whose activity consists in providing publicly available directory enquiry services and directories not only
            data relating to their own subscribers but also data in their possession relating to subscribers of third-party undertakings.
Article 12 of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing
            of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic
            communications) must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation under which an undertaking publishing public directories
            must pass personal data in its possession relating to subscribers of other telephone service providers to a third-party undertaking
            whose activity consists in publishing a printed or electronic public directory or making such directories obtainable through
            directory enquiry services, and under which the passing on of those data is not conditional on renewed consent from the subscribers,
            provided, however, that those subscribers have been informed, before the first inclusion of their data in a public directory,
            of the purpose of that directory and of the fact that those data could be communicated to another telephone service provider
            and that it is guaranteed that those data will not, once passed on, be used for purposes other than those for which they were
            collected with a view to their first publication.
