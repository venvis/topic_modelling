Article 3(1) of Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (‘Unfair Commercial Practices Directive’),
must be interpreted as meaning that the drafting by an assurance undertaking of a standard group life assurance contract linked to an investment fund which does not enable a consumer who is acceding to that group contract on the basis of a proposal from a second undertaking, the policyholder, to understand the nature and structure of the assurance product offered and the risks associated with it may constitute an ‘unfair commercial practice’ within the meaning of that provision and that that assurance undertaking must be held liable for that unfair commercial practice.
Article 3(2) of Directive 2005/29, read in conjunction with Article 13 thereof,
must be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude an interpretation of national law which confers on a consumer who has concluded a contract as a result of an unfair commercial practice on the part of a trader the right to seek the annulment of that contract.
