On those grounds, the Court (Sixth Chamber) hereby rules:
The concept of the ‘total cost of the credit to the consumer’, contained in Article 3(g) of Directive 2008/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 on credit agreements for consumers and repealing Council Directive 87/102/EEC, must be interpreted as meaning that that concept includes the costs for any extension of the credit, provided that, first, the actual and precise conditions for its possible extension, including the duration of that extension, form part of the terms and conditions agreed between the creditor and the borrower in the credit agreement and, second, those costs are known to the creditor.
