The concept of a genetically modified organism within the meaning of Article 2.5 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European
            Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed must be interpreted as meaning that
            a substance such as pollen derived from a variety of genetically modified maize, which has lost its ability to reproduce and
            is totally incapable of transferring the genetic material which it contains, no longer comes within the scope of that concept.
Article 2.1, 2.10 and 2.13 and Article 3(1)(c) of Regulation No 1829/2003, Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the
            European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law,
            establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety, and Article 6(4)(a)
            of Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of
            the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs must be interpreted as meaning that,
            when a substance such as pollen containing genetically modified DNA and genetically modified proteins is not liable to be
            considered as a genetically modified organism, products such as honey and food supplements containing such a substance constitute
            ‘food … containing ingredients produced from [genetically modified organisms]’ within the meaning of Article 3(1)(c) of Regulation
            No 1829/2003. That classification may be made irrespective of whether contamination by the substance in question was intentional
            or adventitious.
Articles 3(1) and 4(2) of Regulation No 1829/2003 must be interpreted as meaning that, when they imply an obligation to authorise
            and supervise a foodstuff, a tolerance threshold such as that provided for in respect of labelling in Article 12(2) of that
            regulation may not be applied to that obligation by analogy.
