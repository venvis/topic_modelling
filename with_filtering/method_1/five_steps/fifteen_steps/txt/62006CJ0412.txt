Council Directive 85/577/EEC of 20 December 1985 to protect the consumer in respect of contracts negotiated away from business
            premises must be interpreted as meaning that the national legislature is entitled to provide that the right of cancellation
            laid down in Article 5(1) of the directive may be exercised no later than one month from the time at which the contracting
            parties have performed in full their obligations under a contract for long-term credit, where the consumer has been given
            defective notice concerning the exercise of that right.
