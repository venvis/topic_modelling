The liability of a service provider which, in the course of providing services such as treatment given in a hospital, uses
            defective equipment or products of which it is not the producer within the meaning of Article 3 of Council Directive 85/374/EEC
            of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning
            liability for defective products, as amended by Directive 1999/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 May
            1999, and thereby causes damage to the recipient of the service does not fall within the scope of the directive. Directive
            85/374 does not therefore prevent a Member State from applying rules, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, under
            which such a provider is liable for damage thus caused, even in the absence of any fault on its part, provided, however, that
            the injured person and/or the service provider retain the right to put in issue the producerâ€™s liability on the basis of the
            directive when the conditions laid down by the latter are fulfilled.
