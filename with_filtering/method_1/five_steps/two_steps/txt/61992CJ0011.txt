On those grounds,  
THE COURT (Fifth Chamber)  
in answer to the question referred to it by the High Court of Justice of England and Wales (Queen' s Bench Division) by order of 12 December 1991, hereby rules:  
Articles 3(3) and 4(4) of Council Directive 89/622/EEC of 13 November 1989 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the labelling of tobacco products are to be interpreted as allowing the Member States to require, so far as domestic production is concerned, that the indications of tar and nicotine yields provided for in Article 3 of that directive and the general and specific warnings provided for in Article 4 of the directive be printed on cigarette packets so as to cover at least 6% of each of the relevant surface areas.
