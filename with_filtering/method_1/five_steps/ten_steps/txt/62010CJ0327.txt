Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in
            civil and commercial matters must be interpreted as meaning that the application of the rules of jurisdiction laid down by
            that regulation requires that the situation at issue in the proceedings of which the court of a Member State is seised is
            such as to raise questions relating to determination of the international jurisdiction of that court. Such a situation arises
            in a case such as that in the main proceedings, in which an action is brought before a court of a Member State against a national
            of another Member State whose domicile is unknown to that court.
Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning that:
in a situation such as that in the main proceedings, in which a consumer who is a party to a long-term mortgage loan contract,
            which includes the obligation to inform the other party to the contract of any change of address, renounces his domicile before
            proceedings against him for breach of his contractual obligations are brought, the courts of the Member State in which the
            consumer had his last known domicile have jurisdiction, pursuant to Article 16(2) of that regulation, to deal with proceedings
            in the case where they have been unable to determine, pursuant to Article 59 of that regulation, the defendant’s current domicile
            and also have no firm evidence allowing them to conclude that the defendant is in fact domiciled outside the European Union;
that regulation does not preclude the application of a provision of national procedural law of a Member State which, with
            a view to avoiding situations of denial of justice, enables proceedings to be brought against, and in the absence of, a person
            whose domicile is unknown, if the court seised of the matter is satisfied, before giving a ruling in those proceedings, that
            all investigations required by the principles of diligence and good faith have been undertaken with a view to tracing the
            defendant.
