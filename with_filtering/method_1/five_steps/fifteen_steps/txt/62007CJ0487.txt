Article 5(2) of First Council Directive 89/104/EEC of 21 December 1988 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating
            to trade marks must be interpreted as meaning that the taking of unfair advantage of the distinctive character or the repute
            of a mark, within the meaning of that provision, does not require that there be a likelihood of confusion or a likelihood
            of detriment to the distinctive character or the repute of the mark or, more generally, to its proprietor. The advantage arising
            from the use by a third party of a sign similar to a mark with a reputation is an advantage taken unfairly by that third party
            of the distinctive character or the repute of that mark where that party seeks by that use to ride on the coat-tails of the
            mark with a reputation in order to benefit from the power of attraction, the reputation and the prestige of that mark and
            to exploit, without paying any financial compensation, the marketing effort expended by the proprietor of the mark in order
            to create and maintain the mark’s image.
Article 5(1)(a) of Directive 89/104 must be interpreted as meaning that the proprietor of a registered trade mark is entitled
            to prevent the use by a third party, in a comparative advertisement which does not satisfy all the conditions, laid down in
            Article 3a(1) of Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 concerning misleading and comparative advertising, as amended
            by Directive 97/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 October 1997, under which comparative advertising
            is permitted, of a sign identical with that mark in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which
            that mark was registered, even where such use is not capable of jeopardising the essential function of the mark, which is
            to indicate the origin of the goods or services, provided that such use affects or is liable to affect one of the other functions
            of the mark. 
Article 3a(1) of Directive 84/450, as amended by Directive 97/55, must be interpreted as meaning that an advertiser who states
            explicitly or implicitly in comparative advertising that the product marketed by him is an imitation of a product bearing
            a well-known trade mark presents ‘goods or services as imitations or replicas’ within the meaning of Article 3a(1)(h). The
            advantage gained by the advertiser as a result of such unlawful comparative advertising must be considered to be an advantage
            taken unfairly of the reputation of that mark within the meaning of Article 3a(1)(g).
