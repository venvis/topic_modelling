Article 2(2a) of Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 concerning misleading and comparative advertising, as amended
            by Directive 97/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 October 1997, is to be interpreted as meaning that
            a reference in an advertisement to a type of product and not to a specific undertaking or product can be considered to be
            comparative advertising where it is possible to identify that undertaking or the goods that it offers as being actually referred
            to by the advertisement. The fact that a number of the advertiser’s competitors or the goods or services that they offer may
            be identified as being in fact referred to by the advertisement is of no relevance for the purpose of recognising the comparative
            nature of the advertising.
The existence of a competitive relationship between the advertiser and the undertaking identified in the advertisement cannot
            be established independently of the goods or services offered by that undertaking.
In order to determine whether there is a competitive relationship between the advertiser and the undertaking identified in
            the advertisement, it is necessary to consider:
–      the current state of the market and consumer habits and how they might evolve,
–      the part of the Community territory in which the advertising is disseminated, without, however, excluding, where appropriate,
            the effects which the evolution of consumer habits seen in other Member States may have on the national market at issue, and
–      the particular characteristics of the product which the advertiser seeks to promote and the image which it wishes to impart
            to it.
The criteria for establishing the existence of a competitive relationship within the meaning of Article 2(2a) of Directive
            84/450, as amended by Directive 97/55, are not identical to those for determining whether the comparison fulfils the condition
            in Article 3a(1)(b) of the same directive. 
Advertising which refers to a type of product without thereby identifying a competitor or the goods which it offers is not
            impermissible with regard to Article 3a(1) of Directive 84/450, as amended by Directive 97/55. The conditions governing whether
            such advertising is permissible must be assessed in the light of other provisions of national law or, where appropriate, of
            Community law, irrespective of the fact that that could mean a lower level of protection for consumers or competing undertakings.
Article 3a(1)(f) of Directive 84/450, as amended by Directive 97/55, must be interpreted as meaning that, for products without
            designation of origin, any comparison which relates to products with designation of origin is not impermissible.
