On those grounds,  
THE COURT (First Chamber),  
in answer to the questions referred to it by the Cour d' Appel de Paris by judgment dated 17 November 1989, hereby rules:  
(1) A trader canvassed with a view to the conclusion of an advertising contract concerning the sale of his business is not to be regarded as a consumer protected by Council Directive 85/577/EEC of 20 December 1985 to protect the consumer in respect of contracts negotiated away from business premises;  
(2) That directive does not preclude national legislation on canvassing from extending the protection which it affords to cover traders acting with a view to the sale of their business.
