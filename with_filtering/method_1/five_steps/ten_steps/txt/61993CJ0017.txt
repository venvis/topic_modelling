On those grounds,  
THE COURT (Fifth Chamber),  
in answer to the questions referred to it by the Rechtbank van Eerste Aanleg, Ghent, by judgment of 15 January 1993, hereby rules:  
1. National legislation prohibiting the marketing of bread and other bakery products whose salt content by reference to the dry matter exceeds the maximum permitted level of 2%, when applied to products which have been lawfully manufactured and marketed in another Member State, constitutes a measure having equivalent effect to a quantitative restriction within the meaning of Article 30 of the EEC Treaty.  
2. Rules such as those at issue in the main proceedings are likely to hinder trade between Member States and cannot be regarded as justified under Article 36 of the EEC Treaty on the ground of protecting public health.  
3. In the context of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer, a Member State which had made it obligatory to designate, as provided by the second indent of Article 6(5)(b), either the specific name or the EEC number of the ingredients listed in Annex II to that directive, was entitled to rely on the imperative requirement of protecting consumers in order to prohibit the marketing of a product from another Member State which had chosen to exercise the option allowed by Article 23(1)(a) of that directive and to require only designation of the general category "preservative".
