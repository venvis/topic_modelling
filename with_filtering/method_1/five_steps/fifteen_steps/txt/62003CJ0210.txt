On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) rules as follows:
Consideration of the second question has not disclosed any factor of such a kind as to affect the validity of Article 8 of
                     Directive 2001/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2001 on the approximation of the laws, regulations
                     and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products.
Where a national measure prohibits the marketing of tobacco products for oral use in accordance with the provisions of Article
                     8 of Directive 2001/37, there is no need to ascertain separately whether that national measure complies with Articles 28 EC
                     and 29 EC.
