Where goods located in a third State, which bear a trade mark registered in a Member State of the European Union or a Community
            trade mark and have not previously been put on the market in the European Economic Area or, in the case of a Community trade
            mark, in the European Union, (i) are sold by an economic operator on an online marketplace without the consent of the trade
            mark proprietor to a consumer located in the territory covered by the trade mark or (ii) are offered for sale or advertised
            on such a marketplace targeted at consumers located in that territory, the trade mark proprietor may prevent that sale, offer
            for sale or advertising by virtue of the rules set out in Article 5 of First Council Directive 89/104/EEC of 21 December 1988
            to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks, as amended by the Agreement on the European Economic
            Area of 2 May 1992, or in Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94 of 20 December 1993 on the Community trade mark. It
            is the task of the national courts to assess on a case-by-case basis whether relevant factors exist, on the basis of which
            it may be concluded that an offer for sale or an advertisement displayed on an online marketplace accessible from the territory
            covered by the trade mark is targeted at consumers in that territory.
Where the proprietor of a trade mark supplies to its authorised distributors items bearing that mark, intended for demonstration
            to consumers in authorised retail outlets, and bottles bearing the mark from which small quantities can be taken for supply
            to consumers as free samples, those goods, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, are not put on the market within
            the meaning of Directive 89/104 and Regulation No 40/94.
Article 5 of Directive 89/104 and Article 9 of Regulation No 40/94 must be interpreted as meaning that the proprietor of a
            trade mark may, by virtue of the exclusive right conferred by the mark, oppose the resale of goods such as those at issue
            in the main proceedings, on the ground that the person reselling the goods has removed their packaging, where the consequence
            of that removal is that essential information, such as information relating to the identity of the manufacturer or the person
            responsible for marketing the cosmetic product, is missing. Where the removal of the packaging has not resulted in the absence
            of that information, the trade mark proprietor may nevertheless oppose the resale of an unboxed perfume or cosmetic product
            bearing his trade mark, if he establishes that the removal of the packaging has damaged the image of the product and, hence,
            the reputation of the trade mark.
On a proper construction of Article 5(1)(a) of Directive 89/104 and Article 9(1)(a) of Regulation No 40/94, the proprietor
            of a trade mark is entitled to prevent an online marketplace operator from advertising – on the basis of a keyword which is
            identical to his trade mark and which has been selected in an internet referencing service by that operator – goods bearing
            that trade mark which are offered for sale on the marketplace, where the advertising does not enable reasonably well-informed
            and reasonably observant internet users, or enables them only with difficulty, to ascertain whether the goods concerned originate
            from the proprietor of the trade mark or from an undertaking economically linked to that proprietor or, on the contrary, originate
            from a third party.
The operator of an online marketplace does not ‘use’ – for the purposes of Article 5 of Directive 89/104 or Article 9 of Regulation
            No 40/94 – signs identical with or similar to trade marks which appear in offers for sale displayed on its site.
Article 14(1) of Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects
            of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (‘Directive on electronic commerce’)
            must be interpreted as applying to the operator of an online marketplace where that operator has not played an active role
            allowing it to have knowledge or control of the data stored. 
The operator plays such a role when it provides assistance which entails, in particular, optimising the presentation of the
            offers for sale in question or promoting them.
Where the operator of the online marketplace has not played an active role within the meaning of the preceding paragraph and
            the service provided falls, as a consequence, within the scope of Article 14(1) of Directive 2000/31, the operator none the
            less cannot, in a case which may result in an order to pay damages, rely on the exemption from liability provided for in that
            provision if it was aware of facts or circumstances on the basis of which a diligent economic operator should have realised
            that the offers for sale in question were unlawful and, in the event of it being so aware, failed to act expeditiously in
            accordance with Article 14(1)(b) of Directive 2000/31.
The third sentence of Article 11 of Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on
            the enforcement of intellectual property rights must be interpreted as requiring the Member States to ensure that the national
            courts with jurisdiction in relation to the protection of intellectual property rights are able to order the operator of an
            online marketplace to take measures which contribute, not only to bringing to an end infringements of those rights by users
            of that marketplace, but also to preventing further infringements of that kind. Those injunctions must be effective, proportionate,
            and dissuasive and must not create barriers to legitimate trade.
