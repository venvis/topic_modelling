1.
 Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin
            for agricultural products and foodstuffs, as amended by the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of
            Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden and the adjustments to the Treaties on which the European Union
            is founded, must be interpreted as not precluding the use of a protected designation of origin from being subject to the condition
            that operations such as the slicing and packaging of the product take place in the region of production, where such a condition
            is laid down in the specification. 
            

2.
 Where the use of the protected designation of origin  
            Prosciutto di Parma for ham marketed in slices is made subject to the condition that slicing and packaging operations be carried out in the region
            of production, this constitutes a measure having equivalent effect to a quantitative restriction on exports within the meaning
            of Article 29 EC, but may be regarded as justified, and hence compatible with that provision. 
            

3.
 However, the condition in question cannot be relied on against economic operators, as it was not brought to their attention
            by adequate publicity in Community legislation.
