On those grounds,
THE COURT, 
in answer to the questions referred to it by the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Dijon by judgments of 26 February 1997, hereby rules: 
1. Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs must be interpreted as meaning that, since its entry into force, a Member State may not, by adopting provisions of national law, alter a designation of origin for which it has requested registration in accordance with Article 17 and protect that designation at national level. 
2. As regards a `compound' designation of origin, the fact that there is no footnote in the annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1107/96 of 12 June 1996 on the registration of geographical indications and designations of origin under the procedure laid down in Article 17 of Regulation No 2081/92 specifying that registration is not sought for one of the parts of that designation does not necessarily mean that each of its constituent parts is protected.
