On those grounds,
THE COURT (Fifth Chamber),
in answer to the question submitted to it by the Juzgado de Primera Instancia e Instrucci√≥n no 5 de Oviedo by order of 13 April 2000, hereby rules:
Article 13 of Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products must be interpreted as meaning that the rights conferred under the legislation of a Member State on the victims of damage caused by a defective product under a general system of liability having the same basis as that put in place by the Directive may be limited or restricted as a result of the Directive's transposition into the domestic law of that State.
