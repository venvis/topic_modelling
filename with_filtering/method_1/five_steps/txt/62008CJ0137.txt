The first paragraph of Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice does not preclude a provision of national law which
            provides that the court which initiates a preliminary reference procedure is at the same time to inform, of its own motion,
            the Minister with responsibility for Justice in the Member State concerned. 
Article 267 TFEU must be interpreted as meaning that the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union extends
            to the interpretation of the concept of ‘unfair term’ used in Article 3(1) of Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993
            on unfair terms in consumer contracts and in the annex thereto, and to the criteria which the national court may or must apply
            when examining a contractual term in the light of the provisions of that Directive, bearing in mind that it is for that court
            to determine, in the light of those criteria, whether a particular contractual term is actually unfair in the circumstances
            of the case. 
The national court must investigate of its own motion whether a term conferring exclusive territorial jurisdiction in a contract
            concluded between a seller or supplier and a consumer, which is the subject of a dispute before it, falls within the scope
            of Directive 93/13 and, if it does, assess of its own motion whether such a term is unfair.
