Article 6(1) of Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts must be interpreted as meaning that the national court, on receiving an application for an order for payment and where the debtor-consumer concerned does not take part in the proceedings until the order for payment is issued, is obliged to disapply ex officio an unfair term in the consumer credit agreement concluded between that consumer and the seller or supplier concerned, on which a part of the claim relied on is based. In that case, that court has the option of rejecting that application in part, provided that that agreement can continue in existence without any further amendment, revision or supplementation, which it is for the court to verify.
Article 6(1) of Directive 93/13 must be interpreted as meaning that, while that provision obliges the national court, on receiving an application for an order for payment, to establish all the consequences, arising under national law, of a finding that a term in a consumer credit agreement concluded between a consumer and a seller or supplier is unfair, in order to ensure that that consumer is not bound by it, that does not, in principle, oblige that court to offset ex officio the payment made on the basis of that term against the balance due under that agreement, subject, however, to compliance with the principles of equivalence and effectiveness.
Article 6(1) of Directive 93/13 must be interpreted as meaning that, where, under that provision, read in the light of the principles of equivalence and effectiveness, the national court, on receiving an application for an order for payment, would be obliged to offset ex officio the payment made on the basis of an unfair term in a consumer credit agreement against the balance due under that agreement, that court is obliged to disregard the case-law of a higher court to the contrary.
