On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:
Article 11(2) of Council Directive 87/102/EEC of 22 December 1986 for the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning consumer credit is to be interpreted as meaning that, in a situation such as that in the main proceedings, an agreement between a supplier and a grantor of credit whereunder credit is made available exclusively by that grantor of credit to customers of that supplier is not a necessary condition for the right of those customers to pursue remedies against the grantor of credit – where the supplier is in breach of contract – in order to obtain the termination of the credit agreement and the subsequent reimbursement of the sums already paid to the grantor of credit.
