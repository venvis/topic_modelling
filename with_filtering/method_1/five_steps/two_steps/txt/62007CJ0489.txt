The provisions of the second sentence of Article 6(1) and Article 6(2) of Directive 97/7/EC of the European Parliament and
            of the Council of 20Â May 1997 on the protection of consumers in respect of distance contracts must be interpreted as precluding
            a provision of national law which provides in general that, in the case of withdrawal by a consumer within the withdrawal
            period, a seller may claim compensation for the value of the use of the consumer goods acquired under a distance contract.
However, those provisions do not prevent the consumer from being required to pay compensation for the use of the goods in
            the case where he has made use of those goods in a manner incompatible with the principles of civil law, such as those of
            good faith or unjust enrichment, on condition that the purpose of that directive and, in particular, the efficiency and effectiveness
            of the right of withdrawal are not adversely affected, this being a matter for the national court to determine.
