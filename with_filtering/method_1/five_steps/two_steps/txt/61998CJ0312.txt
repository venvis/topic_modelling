On those grounds,
THE COURT
in answer to the question referred to it by the Bundesgerichtshof, by order of 2 July 1998, hereby rules:
Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs does not preclude the application of national legislation which prohibits the potentially misleading use of a geographical indication of source in the case of which there is no link between the characteristics of the product and its geographical provenance.
