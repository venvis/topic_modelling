It follows from paragraph 101 of the judgment of 18 November 2003 in Case C‑216/01 Budĕjovický Budvar that:
in order to determine whether a designation can be considered to constitute a simple and indirect indication of geographical
            provenance, protection of which under the bilateral instruments at issue is capable of being justified on the basis of the
            criteria laid down in Article 30 EC, the national court must ascertain whether, according to factual circumstances and perceptions
            prevailing in the Czech Republic, that designation, even if it is not in itself a geographical name, is at least capable of
            informing the consumer that the product bearing that indication comes from a particular place or region of that Member State;
the national court must, in addition, ascertain, once again in the light of factual circumstances and perceptions prevailing
            in the Czech Republic, whether, as stated in paragraph 99 of that judgment, the designation at issue in the main proceedings
            has not, either at the time of the entry into force of the bilateral instruments at issue in the main proceedings or subsequently,
            become generic in that Member State, the Court of Justice of the European Communities having already held, in paragraphs 99
            and 100 of that judgment, that the aim of the system of protection introduced by those instruments falls within the sphere
            of the protection of industrial and commercial property within the meaning of Article 30 EC; 
in the absence of any Community provision in that regard, it is for the national court to decide, in accordance with its own
            national law, whether a consumer survey should be commissioned for the purpose of clarifying the factual circumstances and
            perceptions prevailing in the Czech Republic in order to ascertain whether the designation ‘Bud’ at issue in the main proceedings
            can be classified as a simple and indirect indication of geographical provenance and has not become generic in that Member
            State. It is also in the light of that national law that the national court, if it finds it necessary to commission a consumer
            survey, must determine, for the purposes of making the necessary assessments, the percentage of consumers that would be sufficiently
            significant; and
Article 30 EC does not lay down specific requirements as to the quality and the duration of the use made of a designation
            in the Member State of origin for its protection to be justified in the light of that article. Whether such requirements apply
            in the context of the dispute in the main proceedings must be determined by the national court in the light of the applicable
            national law, in particular the system of protection laid down by the bilateral instruments at issue in the main proceedings.
The Community system of protection laid down by Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20 March 2006 on the protection of
            geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs is exhaustive in nature, with
            the result that that regulation precludes the application of a system of protection laid down by agreements between two Member
            States, such as the bilateral instruments at issue in the main proceedings, which confers on a designation, which is recognised
            under the law of a Member State as constituting a designation of origin, protection in another Member State where that protection
            is actually claimed, despite the fact that no application for registration of that designation of origin has been made in
            accordance with that regulation.
