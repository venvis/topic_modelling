Article 34 of Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on Universal Service and
            users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive) must be interpreted
            as not precluding legislation of a Member State under which the admissibility before the courts of actions relating to electronic
            communications services between end-users and providers of those services, concerning the rights conferred by that directive,
            is conditional upon an attempt to settle the dispute out of court. 
Nor do the principles of equivalence and effectiveness or the principle of effective judicial protection preclude national
            legislation which imposes, in respect of such disputes, prior implementation of an out-of-court settlement procedure, provided
            that that procedure does not result in a decision which is binding on the parties, that it does not cause a substantial delay
            for the purposes of bringing legal proceedings, that it suspends the period for the time-barring of claims and that it does
            not give rise to costs – or gives rise to very low costs – for the parties, and only if electronic means is not the only means
            by which the settlement procedure may be accessed and interim measures are possible in exceptional cases where the urgency
            of the situation so requires.
