Articles 4(2) and 8 of Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts must be interpreted
            as not precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which authorises a judicial review
            as to the unfairness of contractual terms which relate to the definition of the main subject‑matter of the contract or to
            the adequacy of the price and remuneration, on the one hand, as against the services or goods to be supplied in exchange,
            on the other hand, even in the case where those terms are drafted in plain, intelligible language.
Articles 2 EC, 3(1)(g) EC and 4(1) EC do not preclude an interpretation of Articles 4(2) and 8 of Directive 93/13 according
            to which Member States may adopt national legislation which authorises a judicial review as to the unfairness of contractual
            terms which relate to the definition of the main subject‑matter of the contract or to the adequacy of the price and remuneration,
            on the one hand, as against the services or goods to be supplied in exchange, on the other hand, even in the case where those
            terms are drafted in plain, intelligible language.
