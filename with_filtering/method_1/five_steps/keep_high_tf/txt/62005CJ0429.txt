On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:
1. Articles 11 and 14 of Council Directive 87/102/EEC of 22 December 1986 for the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning consumer credit, as amended by Directive 98/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998, must be interpreted as meaning that the right to pursue remedies, provided for in Article 11(2) of Directive 87/102, as amended, which the consumer enjoys against the grantor of credit, may not be made subject to the condition that the prior offer of credit must indicate the goods or services being financed. 
2. Directive 87/102, as amended by Directive 98/7, must be interpreted as allowing national courts to apply of their own motion the provisions transposing Article 11(2) of DirectiveÂ 87/102 into national law.
