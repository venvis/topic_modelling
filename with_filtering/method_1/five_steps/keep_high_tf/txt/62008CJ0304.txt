Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial
            practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of
            the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council
            (‘Unfair Commercial Practices Directive’) must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in
            the main proceedings, which provides for a prohibition in principle, without taking account of the specific circumstances
            of individual cases, of commercial practices under which the participation of consumers in a prize competition or lottery
            is made conditional on the purchase of goods or the use of services.
