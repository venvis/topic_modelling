The classification of a product as a medicinal product or as a foodstuff must take account of all the characteristics of the
            product, established both in the initial stage of the product and where it is mixed, in accordance with the method by which
            it is used, with water or with yoghurt.
Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles
            and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food
            safety constitutes an additional set of rules in relation to Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
            of 10 June 2002 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements, the application of which
            is precluded to the extent to which a Community rule, such as that directive, contains specific provisions for certain categories
            of foodstuffs.
Only the provisions of Community law specific to medicinal products apply to a product which satisfies equally well the conditions
            for classification as a foodstuff and the conditions for classification as a medicinal product.
The pharmacological properties of a product are the factor on the basis of which the authorities of the Member States must
            ascertain, in the light of the potential capacities of the product, whether it may, for the purposes of the second subparagraph
            of Article 1(2) of Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community
            code relating to medicinal products for human use, be administered to human beings with a view to making a medical diagnosis
            or to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions in human beings. The risk that the use of a product may entail
            for health is an autonomous factor that must also be taken into consideration by the competent national authorities in the
            context of the classification of the product as a medicinal product.
A product which constitutes a medicinal product within the meaning of Directive 2001/83 may be imported into another Member
            State only upon acquisition of a marketing authorisation issued in accordance with the provisions of that directive, even
            where it is lawfully marketed as a foodstuff in another Member State.
The concept of ‘upper safe levels’ in Article 5(1)(a) of Directive 2002/46 is of no importance for the purposes of drawing
            a distinction between medicinal products and foodstuffs.
In the context of an evaluation by a Member State of the risks that foodstuffs or food supplements may constitute for human
            health, the criterion of the existence of a nutritional need in the population of the Member State may be taken into consideration.
            However, the absence of such a need does not in itself suffice to justify, either under Article 30 EC or under Article 12
            of Directive 2002/46, a complete ban on marketing foodstuffs or food supplements lawfully manufactured or placed on the market
            in another Member State.
The fact that the discretion enjoyed by the national authorities as regards the establishment of an absence of nutritional
            need is subject to only limited review by the courts is compatible with Community law, on condition that the national procedure
            for judicial review of the decisions in that regard taken by those authorities enables the court or tribunal seised of an
            application for annulment of such a decision effectively to apply the relevant principles and rules of Community law when
            reviewing its legality.
Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel
            foods and novel food ingredients is to be interpreted as meaning that a food or a food ingredient has not been used for human
            consumption to a significant degree within the Community if, when all the circumstances of the case are taken into account,
            it is established that that food or that food ingredient has not been consumed in a significant quantity by humans in any
            of the Member States before the reference date. 15 May 1997 is the reference date for the purpose of determining the extent
            of human consumption of that food or food ingredient.
A national court cannot refer questions on the classification of products to the European Food Safety Authority. An opinion
            delivered by that Authority, possibly in a matter forming the subject-matter of a dispute pending before a national court,
            may constitute evidence that that court should take into consideration in the context of that dispute.
