 Article 28 EC and Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations
            of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 535/97 of 17 March 1997, do not
            preclude the application of a provision of a bilateral agreement between a Member State and a non-member country under which
            a simple and indirect indication of geographical origin from that non-member country is accorded protection in the importing
            Member State, whether or not there is any risk of consumers being misled, and the import of a product lawfully marketed in
            another Member State may be prevented. 
            

2.
 Article 28 EC precludes the application of a provision of a bilateral agreement between a Member State and a non-member country
            under which a name which in that country does not directly or indirectly refer to the geographical source of the product that
            it designates is accorded protection in the importing Member State, whether or not there is any risk of consumers being misled,
            and the import of a product lawfully marketed in another Member State may be prevented. 
            

3.
 The first paragraph of Article 307 EC is to be interpreted as permitting a court of a Member State, subject to the findings
            to be made by that court having regard inter alia to the criteria set out in this judgment, to apply the provisions of bilateral
            agreements such as those at issue in the main proceedings, concluded between that State and a non-member country and according
            protection to a name from the non-member country, even where those provisions prove to be contrary to the EC Treaty rules,
            on the ground that they concern an obligation resulting from agreements concluded before the date of the accession of the
            Member State concerned to the European Union. Pending the success of one of the methods referred to in the second paragraph
            of Article 307 EC in eliminating any incompatibilities between an agreement predating that accession and the Treaty, the first
            paragraph of that article permits that State to continue to apply such an agreement in so far as it contains obligations which
            remain binding on that State under international law.
