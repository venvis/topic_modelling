On those grounds,  
THE COURT (Fifth Chamber),  
in answer to the questions referred to it by the Consiglio di Stato in Sede Giurisdizionale, by order of 27 August 1991, hereby rules:  
1. Article 4(5) of Council Directive 89/622/EEC of 13 November 1989 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the labelling of tobacco products, in its original version, is to be interpreted as meaning that Member States may not require that, so far as national production is concerned, on unit packets of tobacco products other than cigarette packets the general warning referred to in Article 4(1) must cover at least 4% of the surface on which it is printed. Member States may, however, impose such a requirement under the version of Article 4(5) laid down in Council Directive 92/41/EEC of 15 May 1992 amending Directive 89/622.  
2. Article 4(2) of Directive 89/622 requires only one specific warning to be printed on each cigarette packet and Member States may not therefore require more than one such warning.
