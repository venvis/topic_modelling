Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5Â April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts must be interpreted, in the light of the principle of effectiveness, as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, under which the national court before which an application has been brought for enforcement of a mortgage contract, concluded between a seller or supplier and a consumer in the form of a directly enforceable notarial instrument, does not have the option, either on application by the consumer or of its own motion, to examine whether the terms in such an instrument are unfair within the meaning of that directive, and on that basis to suspend the enforcement sought.
