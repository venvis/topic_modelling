On those grounds, 
THE COURT 
(First Chamber), 
in answer to the question referred to it by the Amtsgericht Nordhorn by order of 30 October 1997, hereby rules: 
It is contrary to Article 30 of the EC Treaty for national rules to prohibit, for reasons of consumer protection, the marketing of foodstuffs lawfully manufactured and marketed in another Member State, where consumers are protected by means of labelling in accordance with the provisions of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs, in particular those concerning the description of products and the list of ingredients. 
It is contrary to Articles 2 and 5(1) of Directive 79/112 to use a trade description which does not make it possible for purchasers in the State where the product is sold to ascertain the true nature of the foodstuff. 
Where the quantity of added water represents more than 5% by weight of the finished product, failure to include `water' in the list of ingredients constitutes infringement of Article 3(1), read in conjunction with Article 6(5)(a), of Directive 79/112.
