Directives:
2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services,
            in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (‘Directive on electronic commerce’);
2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright
            and related rights in the information society;
2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights
            ; 
95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to
            the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data; and 
2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the
            protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), 
read together and construed in the light of the requirements stemming from the protection of the applicable fundamental rights,
            must be interpreted as precluding an injunction made against an internet service provider which requires it to install a system
            for filtering
all electronic communications passing via its services, in particular those involving the use of peer-to-peer software; 
which applies indiscriminately to all its customers; 
as a preventive measure; 
exclusively at its expense; and
for an unlimited period, 
which is capable of identifying on that provider’s network the movement of electronic files containing a musical, cinematographic
            or audio-visual work in respect of which the applicant claims to hold intellectual-property rights, with a view to blocking
            the transfer of files the sharing of which infringes copyright.
