Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts must be interpreted as meaning that a national
            court or tribunal hearing an action for enforcement of an arbitration award which has become final and was made in the absence
            of the consumer is required, where it has available to it the legal and factual elements necessary for that task, to assess
            of its own motion whether an arbitration clause in a contract concluded between a seller or supplier and a consumer is unfair,
            in so far as, under national rules of procedure, it can carry out such an assessment in similar actions of a domestic nature.
            If that is the case, it is for that court or tribunal to establish all the consequences thereby arising under national law,
            in order to ensure that the consumer is not bound by that clause.
