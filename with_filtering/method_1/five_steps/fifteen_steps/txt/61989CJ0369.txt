On those grounds,  
THE COURT (Fifth Chamber),  
in reply to the question referred to it by the Rechtbank van Koophandel, Louvain, by order of 5 December 1989, hereby rules:  
Article 30 of the EEC Treaty and Article 14 of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer preclude a national law from requiring the exclusive use of a specific language for the labelling of foodstuffs, without allowing for the possibility of using another language easily understood by purchasers or of ensuring that the purchaser is informed by other measures.
