The concepts of ‘foodstuffs for human consumption’ and ‘products normally used to supplement foodstuffs or as a substitute for foodstuffs’, set out in point 1 of Annex III to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax, must be interpreted as meaning that they refer to all products containing nutrients which serve as building blocks, generate energy and regulate its functions, which are necessary to keep the human body alive and enable it to function and develop, and which are consumed in order to provide it with those nutrients.
