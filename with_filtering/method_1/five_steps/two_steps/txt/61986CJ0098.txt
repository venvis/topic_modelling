On those grounds,  
THE COURT ( Third Chamber )  
in answer to the question referred to it by the tribunal de premi√®re instance de Dinant by a judgment of 6 March 1986, hereby rules :  
Neither Article 30 of the EEC Treaty, nor any other provision of the EEC Treaty, nor any general principle of Community law makes it unlawful for certain provisions of national legislation, themselves in conformity with a Community directive, to apply only to domestically-produced products, to the exclusion of those coming from other Member States .
