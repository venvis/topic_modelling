Article 12(2)(a) of Directive 2014/17/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 February 2014 on credit agreements for consumers relating to residential immovable property and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which authorises a lender to require a borrower, when concluding a credit agreement relating to immovable property for residential use, as consideration for an individual advantage, to deposit all his or her salary or similar income on a payment account opened with that lender, irrespective of the amount, maturities and duration of the loan. However, that provision must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation under which the duration of the deposit required, where it does not relate to the borrower’s entire income from employment, may be of up to 10 years or, if it is shorter, the duration of the credit agreement concerned.
