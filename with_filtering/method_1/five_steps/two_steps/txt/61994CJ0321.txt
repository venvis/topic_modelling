On those grounds,
THE COURT 
(Fifth Chamber), 
in answer to the question referred to it by the French Cour de Cassation by judgments of 3 October 1994, hereby rules: 
1. Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs does not preclude application of domestic rules, such as those laid down by Article 34 of Law No 85-30 of 9 January 1985 and Decree No 88-194 of 26 February 1988, which lay down the conditions governing the use of the description `mountain' in relation to agricultural products and foodstuffs. 
2. Article 30 of the EC Treaty precludes application of domestic rules, such as those laid down by Article 34 of Law No 85-30 and Decree No 88-194, which restrict use of the description `mountain' to products manufactured on national territory and prepared from domestic raw materials.
