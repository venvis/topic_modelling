On those grounds,
THE COURT (Sixth Chamber),
in answer to the question referred to it by the Landesgericht Linz by order of 6 April 2000, hereby rules:
Article 5 of Council Directive 90/314/EEC of 13 June 1990 on package travel, package holidays and package tours is to be interpreted as conferring, in principle, on consumers a right to compensation for non-material damage resulting from the non-performance or improper performance of the services constituting a package holiday.
