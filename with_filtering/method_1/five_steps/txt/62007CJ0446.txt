Articles 3(1) and 13(3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications
            and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2796/2000
            of 20 December 2000, must be interpreted as meaning that the designation of a foodstuff containing geographical references,
            which has been the subject of an application for registration as a protected designation of origin or a protected geographical
            indication within the meaning of Regulation No 2081/92, as amended by Regulation No 2796/2000, cannot be regarded as generic
            pending the possible forwarding of the application for registration to the Commission of the European Communities by the national
            authorities. A designation cannot be presumed to be generic, within the meaning of Regulation No 2081/92, as amended by Regulation
            No 2796/2000, for as long as the Commission has not taken a decision on the application for registration of the designation,
            as the case may be, by rejecting it on the specific ground that that designation has become generic.
Articles 3(1) and 13(3) of Regulation No 2081/92, as amended by Regulation No 2796/2000, read with Article 2 of Directive
            2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States
            relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs, must be interpreted as meaning that the designation
            of a foodstuff containing geographical references, which is not registered as a protected designation of origin or a protected
            geographical indication, may legitimately be used, on condition that the labelling of the product so named does not mislead
            the average reasonably well informed, observant and circumspect consumer. For the purpose of assessing whether that is the
            case, national courts may have regard to the length of time during which the name has been used. By contrast, any good faith
            on the part of the manufacturer or retailer is irrelevant in that regard.
