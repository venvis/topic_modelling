On those grounds, 
THE COURT 
(Fifth Chamber), 
hereby: 
1. Declares that, by failing to adopt within the prescribed period the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with Directive 94/47/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 26 October 1994 on the protection of purchasers in respect of certain aspects of contracts relating to the purchase of the right to use immovable properties on a timeshare basis, the Hellenic Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under that directive; 
2. Orders the Hellenic Republic to pay the costs.
