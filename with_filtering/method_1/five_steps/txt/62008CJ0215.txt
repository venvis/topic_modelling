Council Directive 85/577/EEC of 20 December 1985 to protect the consumer in respect of contracts negotiated away from business
            premises applies to a contract, concluded in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, concerning a consumerâ€™s
            entry to a closed-end real property fund established in the form of a partnership when the principal purpose of joining is
            not to become a member of that partnership, but is a means of capital investment.
Article 5(2) of the Directive does not preclude, in circumstances such as those of the main proceedings, a national law according
            to which, in the event of cancellation of membership of a closed-end real property fund established in the form of a partnership,
            entered into following a doorstep transaction, the consumer has a claim against that partnership, to his severance balance,
            calculated on the basis of the value of his interest at the date of his retirement from membership of that fund, and may therefore
            get back less than the value of his capital contribution or have to participate in the losses of that fund.
