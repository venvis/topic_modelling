On those grounds,  
THE COURT (Fifth Chamber)  
hereby:  
1. Declares that, by requiring that b√©arnaise sauce and hollandaise sauce made with vegetable fats and certain pastry products containing the additive "E 160 F" should, in order to be marketed in Germany, carry a trade description with an additional statement indicating that the substance in question has been used, even if that substance is already included in the list of ingredients referred to in Article 6 of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer, the Federal Republic of Germany has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 30 of the EC Treaty;  
2. Dismisses the remainder of the application;  
3. Orders the Federal Republic of Germany to pay the costs.
