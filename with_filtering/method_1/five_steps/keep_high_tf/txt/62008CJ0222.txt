Declares that, 
first, by failing to take into consideration, in the calculation of the net cost of provision of the social component of universal
            service, the market benefits, including intangible benefits, accruing to the undertakings responsible, and 
second, by making a general finding on the basis of the calculation  of the net costs of the erstwhile sole provider of universal
            service that all undertakings now responsible for the provision of universal service are in fact subject to an unfair burden
            on account of that provision and by having done so without carrying out a specific assessment both of the net cost which the
            provision of universal service represents for each operator concerned and of all the characteristics particular to each operator,
            including the quality of its equipment or its economic and financial situation,
the Kingdom of Belgium has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 12(1) and 13(1) of Directive 2002/22/EC of the
            European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications
            networks and services (Universal Service Directive);
Dismisses the action as to the remainder;
Orders the Kingdom of Belgium to pay two thirds of the costs and orders the European Commission to pay one third of the costs.
