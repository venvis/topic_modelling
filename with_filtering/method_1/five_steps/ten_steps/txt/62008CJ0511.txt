Article 6(1), first subparagraph, second sentence, and Article 6(2) of Directive 97/7/EC of the European Parliament and of
            the Council of 20Â May 1997 on the protection of consumers in respect of distance contracts must be interpreted as precluding
            national legislation which allows the supplier under a distance contract to charge the costs of delivering the goods to the
            consumer where the latter exercises his right of withdrawal.
