On those grounds,  
THE COURT (Fifth Chamber),  
in answer to the questions referred to it by the Hof van Beroep, Brussels, by judgment of 24 February 1994, hereby rules:  
1. Article 14 of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer precludes a Member State, with regard to the use of a language easily understood by purchasers, from requiring the use of a language which is that most widely spoken in the area in which the product is offered for sale, even if the use at the same time of another language is not excluded.  
2. All the compulsory particulars specified in Directive 79/112 must appear on the labelling in a language easily understood by consumers in the State or region concerned or by means of other measures such as designs, symbols or pictograms. The ease with which the information supplied can be understood must be assessed in the light of all the circumstances in each individual case.
