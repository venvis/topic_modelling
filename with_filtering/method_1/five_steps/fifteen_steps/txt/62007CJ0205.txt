Article 29 EC does not preclude national rules which prohibit a supplier, in cross-border distance selling, from requiring
            an advance or any payment from a consumer before expiry of the withdrawal period, but Article 29 EC does preclude a prohibition,
            under those rules, on requesting, before expiry of that period, the number of the consumerâ€™s payment card.
