The condition under which comparative advertising is permissible that is laid down by Article 3a(1)(b) of Council Directive
            84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 concerning misleading and comparative advertising, as amended by Directive 97/55/EC of the
            European Parliament and of the Council of 6 October 1997, must be interpreted as not precluding comparative advertising from
            relating collectively to selections of basic consumables sold by two competing chains of stores in so far as those selections
            each consist of individual products which, when viewed in pairs, individually satisfy the requirement of comparability laid
            down by that provision.
Article 3a(1)(c) of Directive 84/450, as amended by Directive 97/55, must be interpreted as meaning that the requirement,
            laid down by that provision, that the advertising ‘objectively compares’ the features of the goods at issue does not signify,
            in the event of comparison of the prices of a selection of comparable basic consumables sold by competing chains of stores
            or of the general level of the prices charged by them in respect of the range of comparable products which they sell, that
            the products and prices compared, that is to say both those of the advertiser and those of all of his competitors involved
            in the comparison, must be expressly and exhaustively listed in the advertisement.
Article 3a(1)(c) of Directive 84/450, as amended by Directive 97/55, must be interpreted as meaning that the following constitute,
            for the purposes of that provision, ‘verifiable’ features of goods sold by two competing chains of stores:
–      the prices of those goods;
the general level of the respective prices charged by such chains of stores in respect of their selection of comparable products
            and the amount liable to be saved by consumers who purchase such products from one rather than the other of those chains,
            in so far as the goods in question do in fact form part of the selection of comparable products on whose basis that general
            price level has been determined.
Article 3a(1)(c) of Directive 84/450, as amended by Directive 97/55, must be interpreted as meaning that a feature mentioned
            in comparative advertising satisfies the requirement of verifiability laid down by that provision, in cases where the details
            of the comparison which form the basis for the mention of that feature are not set out in the advertising, only if the advertiser
            indicates, in particular for the attention of the persons to whom the advertisement is addressed, where and how they may readily
            examine those details with a view to verifying, or, if they do not possess the skill required for that purpose, to having
            verified, the details and the feature in question as to their accuracy.
Article 3a(1)(a) of Directive 84/450, as amended by Directive 97/55, must be interpreted as meaning that comparative advertising
            claiming that the advertiser’s general price level is lower than his main competitors’, where the comparison has related to
            a sample of products, may be misleading when the advertisement:
–      does not reveal that the comparison related only to such a sample and not to all the advertiser’s products,
–      does not identify the details of the comparison made or inform the persons to whom it is addressed of the information source
            where such identification is possible, or
–      contains a collective reference to a range of amounts that may be saved by consumers who make their purchases from the advertiser
            rather than from his competitors without specifying individually the general level of the prices charged, respectively, by
            each of those competitors and the amount that consumers are liable to save by making their purchases from the advertiser rather
            than from each of the competitors.
