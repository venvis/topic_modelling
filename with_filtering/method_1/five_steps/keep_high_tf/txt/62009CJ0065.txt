Article 3(2) and (3) of Directive 1999/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 on certain aspects
            of the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees must be interpreted as meaning that, where consumer goods not in conformity
            with the contract which were installed in good faith by the consumer in a manner consistent with their nature and purpose,
            before the defect became apparent, are restored to conformity by way of replacement, the seller is obliged either to remove
            the goods from where they were installed and to install the replacement goods there or else to bear the cost of that removal
            and installation of the replacement goods. That obligation on the seller exists regardless of whether he was obliged under
            the contract of sale to install the consumer goods originally purchased.
Article 3(3) of Directive 1999/44 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation from granting the seller the right
            to refuse to replace goods not in conformity, as the only remedy possible, on the ground that, because of the obligation to
            remove the goods from where they were installed and to install the replacement goods there, replacement imposes costs on him
            which are disproportionate with regard to the value that the goods would have if there were no lack of conformity and the
            significance of the lack of conformity. That provision does not, however, preclude the consumerâ€™s right to reimbursement of
            the cost of removing the defective goods and of installing the replacement goods from being limited, in such a case, to the
            payment by the seller of a proportionate amount.
