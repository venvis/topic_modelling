On those grounds, 
THE COURT 
(Fifth Chamber) 
hereby: 
1. Declares that, by not making provision in the national legislation transposing Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products for the threshold of EUR 500 referred to in Article 9(b) of the Directive, the Hellenic Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under that provision; 
2. Orders the Hellenic Republic to pay the costs.
