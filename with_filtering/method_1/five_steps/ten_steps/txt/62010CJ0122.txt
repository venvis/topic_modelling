The words ‘thereby enables the consumer to make a purchase’ in Article 2(i) of Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament
            and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending
            Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and
            Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (‘Unfair Commercial Practices Directive’) must
            be interpreted as meaning that an invitation to purchase exists as soon as the information on the product advertised and its
            price is sufficient for the consumer to be able to make a transactional decision, without it being necessary for the commercial
            communication also to offer an actual opportunity to purchase the product or for it to appear in proximity to and at the same
            time as such an opportunity.
Article 2(i) of Directive 2005/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the requirement relating to the indication of the price
            of the product may be met if the commercial communication contains an entry-level price, that is to say the lowest price for
            which the advertised product or category of products can be bought, while the advertised product or category of products are
            available in other versions or with other content at prices which are not indicated. It is for the national court to ascertain,
            on the basis of the nature and characteristics of the product and the commercial medium of communication used, whether the
            reference to an entry-level price enables the consumer to take a transactional decision.
Article 2(i) of Directive 2005/29 must be interpreted as meaning that a verbal or visual reference to the product makes it
            possible to meet the requirement relating to the indication of the product’s characteristics, and that includes a situation
            where such a verbal or visual reference is used to designate a product which is offered in many versions. It is for the national
            court to ascertain, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the nature and characteristics of the product and the medium
            of communication used, whether the consumer has sufficient information to identify and distinguish the product for the purpose
            of taking a transactional decision.
Article 7(4)(a) of Directive 2005/29 must be interpreted as meaning that it may be sufficient for only certain of a product’s
            main characteristics to be given and for the trader to refer in addition to its website, on the condition that on that site
            there is essential information on the product’s main characteristics, price and other terms in accordance with the requirements
            in Article 7 of that directive. It is for the national court to assess, on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration
            the context of the invitation to purchase, the medium of communication used and the nature and characteristics of the product,
            whether a reference only to certain main characteristics of the product enables the consumer to take an informed transactional
            decision.
Article 7(4)(c) of Directive 2005/29 must be interpreted as meaning that a reference only to an entry-level price in an invitation
            to purchase cannot be regarded, in itself, as constituting a misleading omission. It is for the national court to ascertain
            whether a reference to an entry-level price is sufficient for the requirements concerning the reference to a price, such as
            those set out in that provision, to be considered to be met. That court will have to ascertain, inter alia, whether the omission
            of the detailed rules for calculating the final price prevents the consumer from taking an informed transactional decision
            and, consequently, leads him to take a transactional decision which he would not otherwise have taken. It is also for the
            national court to take into consideration the limitations forming an integral part of the medium of communication used; the
            nature and the characteristics of the product and the other measures that the trader has actually taken to make the information
            available to consumers.
