Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users’ rights
            relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive) does not in principle preclude,
            by itself, the national legislature from acting as national regulatory authority within the meaning of Directive 2002/21/EC
            of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications
            networks and services (Framework Directive) provided that, in the exercise of that function, it meets the requirements of
            competence, independence, impartiality and transparency laid down by those directives and that its decisions in the exercise
            of that function can be made the object of an effective appeal to a body independent of the parties involved, which it is
            for the Grondwettelijk Hof to determine.
Article 12 of Directive 2002/22 does not preclude a national regulatory authority from determining generally and on the basis
            of the calculation of the net costs of the universal service provider which was previously the sole provider of that service
            that the provision of universal service may represent an ‘unfair burden’ for those undertakings designated as universal service
            providers.
Article 13 of Directive 2002/22 precludes that authority from deciding in the same way and on the basis of the same calculation
            that those undertakings are effectively subject to an unfair burden because of that provision, without having undertaken a
            specific examination of the situation of each of them.
