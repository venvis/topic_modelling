 Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the
               Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs does not preclude a national rule which
               provides that, where the period of minimum durability of a foodstuff expired, that fact must be indicated separately, clearly
               and in a generally intelligible manner. Such a rule is a non-harmonised national provision justified on the ground of prevention
               of fraud as provided for in Article 18(2) of the directive.
