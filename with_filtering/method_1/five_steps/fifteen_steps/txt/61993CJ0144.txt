On those grounds,  
THE COURT (First Chamber),  
in answer to the question referred to it by the Bundesverwaltungsgericht, by order of 26 November 1992, hereby rules:  
On a proper construction of the first indent of Article 6(4)(c)(ii) of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer, an additive preventing discoloration of an ingredient during its manufacture no longer serves a technological function in the finished product, where its presence in the finished product is no longer necessary to prevent the discoloration of that product.
