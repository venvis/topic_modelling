Article 1(2) of Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts must be interpreted as excluding from the scope of that directive a term in a contract between a seller or supplier and a consumer which reflects a national legislative or regulatory provision of a supplementary nature – in other words one which applies by default, in the absence of any other arrangement between the parties – even if that clause has not been individually negotiated.
Article 1(2) of Directive 93/13 must be interpreted as meaning that the terms referred to in that provision are excluded from the scope of that directive, even if the provision has not been formally transposed into the legal system of a Member State, and, in such circumstances, the courts of that Member State may not hold that Article 1(2) of the directive has been indirectly incorporated into national law through the transposition of Article 3(1) and Article 4(1) thereof.
Article 8 of Directive 93/13 must be interpreted as not precluding the adoption or retention of provisions of domestic law which have the effect of applying the system of consumer protection provided for by that directive to the terms referred to in Article 1(2) thereof.
