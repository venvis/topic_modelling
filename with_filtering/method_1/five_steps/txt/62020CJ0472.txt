Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5Â April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts must be interpreted as meaning that the effectiveness of the provisions of that directive cannot be ensured, in the absence of a supplementary rule of national law governing such a situation, solely by a non-binding opinion issued by the highest court of the Member State concerned indicating to the lower courts the approach to be taken in order to declare a contract to be valid or effective between parties, where that contract cannot continue in existence because a term relating to its main subject matter is unfair.
Directive 93/13 must be interpreted as not precluding the national court with jurisdiction from deciding to restore the parties to a loan agreement to the situation they would have been in if that agreement had not been concluded on the ground that a term of that agreement relating to its main subject matter must be declared unfair under that directive, provided that, if it is not possible to restore the parties to that position, it must ensure that the consumer is ultimately in the position he or she would have been in if the term held to be unfair had never existed.
