The national rules relating to the selling of contact lenses fall within the scope of Directive 2000/31/EC of the European
            Parliament and the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic
            commerce, in the Internal market (‘Directive on electronic commerce’), since they concern the act of selling such lenses via
            the Internet. On the other hand, the national rules relating to the supply of contact lenses are not covered by that directive.
            
Articles 34 TFEU and 36 TFEU, and Directive 2000/31, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which authorises
            the selling of contact lenses only in shops which specialise in medical devices.
