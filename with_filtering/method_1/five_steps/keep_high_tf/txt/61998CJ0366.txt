On those grounds,
THE COURT,
in answer to the question referred to it by the Cour d'Appel, Lyon, by judgment of 16 September 1998, hereby rules:
1. Article 30 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 28 EC) and Article 14 of Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs, as amended by Commission Directive 93/102/EC of 16 November 1993, do not preclude a national provision from requiring that the labelling of foodstuffs and the labelling methods used must not mislead the purchaser or consumer, particularly as to the characteristics of those foodstuffs.
2. Article 30 of the Treaty and Article 14 of Directive 79/112 preclude a national provision from requiring the use of a specific language for the labelling of foodstuffs, without allowing for the possibility for another language easily understood by purchasers to be used or for the purchaser to be informed by other means.
