On those grounds,  
THE COURT (Sixth Chamber),  
in answer to the question referred to it by the Arrondissementsrechtbank, Leeuwarden (Netherlands), by order of 15 June 1992, hereby rules:  
Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer is to be interpreted as meaning that a national cheese mark comprising not only particulars of the country of production and the type of cheese, but also one or two letters varying according to the region of production, a serial number and a combination of letters or of letters and numbers, does not constitute labelling within the meaning of Article 1(3)(a) of that directive and therefore does not fall within its scope.
