Articles 2, 3 and 12 of Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation
            of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs are to be interpreted
            as not precluding legislation of a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which makes it possible for
            an operator, established in that Member State, which distributes a pre-packaged alcoholic beverage to be delivered as such
            within the meaning of Article 1 of that directive, produced by an operator established in another Member State, to be held
            liable for an infringement of that provision, established by a public authority, resulting from the producerâ€™s inaccurate
            statement on the product label of the alcoholic strength by volume of the product and, consequently, to be penalised by an
            administrative fine, even where, as the mere distributor, it simply markets the product as delivered to it by the producer.
