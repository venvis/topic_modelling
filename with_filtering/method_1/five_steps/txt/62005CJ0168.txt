Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts must be interpreted as meaning that a national
            court seised of an action for annulment of an arbitration award must determine whether the arbitration agreement is void and
            annul that award where that agreement contains an unfair term, even though the consumer has not pleaded that invalidity in
            the course of the arbitration proceedings, but only in that of the action for annulment.
