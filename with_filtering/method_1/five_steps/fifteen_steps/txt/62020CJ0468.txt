On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:
Articles 49 and 56 TFEU and Article 8(1), first subparagraph, (2)(a), (4)(b) and (d) and (5)(b) of Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive), as amended by Directive 2009/140/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009, and Articles 20 to 22 of Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive), as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009, read in conjunction with the principles of proportionality and equal treatment,
must be interpreted as meaning that they do not preclude national legislation which confers on the national regulatory authority the power to adopt a decision requiring, on the one hand, mobile telephony service operators to have a time frame for the renewal of commercial offers and billing of not less than four weeks and, on the other hand, operators of fixed telephony and related services to have a time frame for the renewal of such offers and billing of one month or multiples thereof, provided that the two categories of services in question are, in the light of the subject matter and purpose of that national legislation, in different situations.
