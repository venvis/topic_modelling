Article 2(2)(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1139/98 of 26 May 1998 concerning the compulsory indication on the labelling
            of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms of particulars other than those provided for in Directive
            79/112/EEC, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 49/2000 of 10 January 2000, is to be interpreted as meaning that the
            exemption for which it provides from the obligation, laid down in Article 2(1) and (3) of that regulation, to state on the
            labelling of foodstuffs that material derived from certain GMOs is present, where such presence is the result of adventitious
            contamination and does not exceed a de minimis  threshold of 1% also applies to foodstuffs intended for the particular nutritional use of infants and young children.
