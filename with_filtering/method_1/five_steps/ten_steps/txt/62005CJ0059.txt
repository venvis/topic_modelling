Article 3a(1)(g) of Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 concerning misleading and comparative advertising, as
            amended by Directive 97/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 October 1997, must be interpreted as meaning
            that, in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, by using in its catalogues the core element of a manufacturerâ€™s
            distinguishing mark which is known in specialist circles, a competing supplier does not take unfair advantage of the reputation
            of that distinguishing mark.
