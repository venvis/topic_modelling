Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 on the definition, description,
            presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of spirit drinks and repealing Council Regulation (EEC)
            No 1576/89 is applicable to the assessment of the validity of the registration of a trade mark containing a geographical indication
            protected by that regulation, where registration took place before the regulation entered into force.
Articles 23 and 16 of Regulation No 110/2008 must be interpreted as meaning that:
the competent national authorities must, on the basis of Article 23(1) of Regulation No 110/2008, refuse or invalidate the
            registration of a mark which contains a protected geographical indication and which is not covered by the temporary derogation
            provided for in Article 23(2) of that regulation, where the use of that mark would lead to one of the situations referred
            to in Article 16 thereof;
a situation such as that referred to in the second question referred for a preliminary ruling – that is to say, the registration
            of a mark containing a geographical indication, or a term corresponding to that indication and its translation, in respect
            of spirit drinks which do not meet the specifications set for that indication – falls within the situations referred to in
            Article 16(a) and (b) of Regulation No 110/2008, without prejudice to the possible application of other rules laid down in
            Article 16.
