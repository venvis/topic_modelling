On those grounds,
THE COURT 
(Fifth Chamber), 
in answer to the question referred to it by the Bundesgerichtshof by order of 11 January 1996, hereby rules: 
On a proper construction of the first indent of Article 2 of Directive 85/577/EEC of 20 December 1985 to protect the consumer in respect of contracts negotiated away from business premises, a contract of guarantee concluded by a natural person who is not acting in the course of his trade or profession does not come within the scope of the directive where it guarantees repayment of a debt contracted by another person who, for his part, is acting within the course of his trade or profession.
