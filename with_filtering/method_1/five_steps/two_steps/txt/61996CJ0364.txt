On those grounds,
THE COURT 
(Fifth Chamber), 
in answer to the question referred to it by the Bezirksgericht f√ºr Handelssachen Wien by order of 21 October 1996, hereby rules: 
Article 7 of Council Directive 90/314/EEC of 13 June 1990 on package travel, package holidays and package tours is to be interpreted as covering, as security for the refund of money paid over, a situation in which the purchaser of a package holiday who has paid the travel organiser for the costs of his accommodation before travelling on his holiday is compelled, following the travel organiser's insolvency, to pay the hotelier for his accommodation again in order to be able to leave the hotel and return home.
