Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial
            practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of
            the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council
            (‘the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive’) must be interpreted as precluding a national provision, such as that at issue
            in the main proceedings, which lays down a general prohibition on sales with bonuses and is not only designed to protect consumers
            but also pursues other objectives;
The possibility of participating in a prize competition, linked to the purchase of a newspaper, does not constitute an unfair
            commercial practice within the meaning of Article 5(2) of Directive 2005/29, simply on the ground that, for at least some
            of the consumers concerned, that possibility of participating in a competition represents the factor which determines them
            to buy that newspaper.
