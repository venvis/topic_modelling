On those grounds,  
THE COURT (Fifth Chamber),  
in answer to the question referred to it by the Examining Magistrate of the Tribunal de Grande Instance, Bergerac, by a letter of 12 December 1990, hereby rules :  
Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 relating to the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning misleading advertising must be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude vehicles from being advertised as new, less expensive and guaranteed by the manufacturer when the vehicles concerned are registered solely for the purpose of importation, have never been on the road, and are sold in a Member State at a price lower than that charged by dealers established in that Member State because they are equipped with fewer accessories.
