Pricing for interconnection related to the provision of number portability, as referred to in Article 30(2) of Directive 2002/22/EC
            of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and usersâ€™ rights relating to electronic
            communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive), concerns the traffic costs of numbers ported and the set-up
            costs incurred by mobile telephone operators to implement requests for number porting.
Article 30(2) of Directive 2002/22 does not preclude the adoption of a national measure laying down the specific method to
            be used in calculating costs and which fixes in advance and on the basis of an abstract model of the costs maximum prices
            which may be charged by the donor operator to the recipient operator as set-up costs, provided that the prices are fixed on
            the basis of the costs in such a way that consumers are not dissuaded from making use of the facility of portability. 
Article 4 of Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework
            for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive) must be interpreted as meaning that the body responsible
            for hearing an appeal against a decision of the national regulatory authority must have at its disposal all the information
            necessary in order to decide on the merits of the appeal, including, if necessary, confidential information which that authority
            has taken into account in reaching the decision which is the subject of the appeal.  However, that body must guarantee the
            confidentiality of the information in question whilst complying with the requirements of effective legal protection and ensuring
            protection of the rights of defence of the parties to the dispute.
