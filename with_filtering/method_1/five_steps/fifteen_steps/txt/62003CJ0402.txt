Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of
            the Member States concerning liability for defective products must be interpreted as:
precluding a national rule under which the supplier is answerable, beyond the cases listed exhaustively in Article 3(3) of
            the directive, for the no-fault liability which the directive establishes and imposes on the producer;
not precluding a national rule under which the supplier is answerable without restriction for the producerâ€™s fault-based liability.
