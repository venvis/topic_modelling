 Articles 1(4)(k) and 6(8) of Council Directive 90/496/EEC of 24 September 1990 on nutrition labelling for foodstuffs must
            be interpreted as meaning that, first, the value of a nutrient such as vitamin C which is indicated on a foodstuff following
            an analysis of the foodstuff carried out by the manufacturer may correspond to the value of that nutrient in the foodstuff
            in question at the end of its minimum conservation period and, second, that the determination of the permissible differences
            between the value stated and the value established in the course of an official check is, in the present state of Community
            law, within the competence of the Member States. 
            

2.
 Consideration of the third question has not disclosed any factor of such a kind as to affect the validity of Directive 90/496.
