On those grounds,  
THE COURT ( Fifth Chamber ),  
in answer to the question submitted to it by the cour d' appel de Paris, by a judgment of 27 November 1987, hereby rules :  
The application to imported products of a prohibition on canvassing in relation to the sale of educational material such as that laid down by the law on the protection of consumers with respect to canvassing and to selling at private dwellings is not incompatible with Article 30 of the Treaty .
