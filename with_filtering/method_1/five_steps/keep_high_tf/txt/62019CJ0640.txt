Articles 55, 65 and 78 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 248/2008 of 17 March 2008, must be interpreted as not excluding the quantities of milk used for the production of cheeses with a protected designation of origin intended for export to countries outside the European Union from the calculation of national quotas for the production of milk and other milk products and of surplus levies.
Examination of the third question referred has not revealed any factors of such a kind as to affect the validity of Articles 55, 65 and 78 of Regulation No 1234/2007 as amended by Regulation No 248/2008.
