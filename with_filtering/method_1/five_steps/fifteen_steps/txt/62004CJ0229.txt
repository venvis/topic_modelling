Articles 1 and 2 of Council Directive 85/577/EEC of 20 December 1985 to protect the consumer in respect of contracts negotiated
            away from business premises must be interpreted as meaning that when a third party intervenes in the name of or on behalf
            of a trader in the negotiation or conclusion of a contract, the application of the Directive cannot be made subject to the
            condition that the trader was or should have been aware that the contract was concluded in a doorstepâ€‘selling situation as
            referred to in Article 1 of the Directive. 
Directive 85/577, and Article 5(2) thereof in particular, does not preclude:
a requirement that a consumer who has exercised his right to cancel under the Directive must pay back the loan proceeds to
            the lender, even though according to the scheme drawn up for the investment the loan serves solely to finance the purchase
            of the immovable property and is paid directly to the vendor thereof;
a requirement that the amount of the loan must be paid back immediately;
national legislation which provides for an obligation on the consumer, in the event of cancellation of a secured credit agreement,
            not only to repay the amounts received under the agreement but also to pay to the lender interest at the market rate;
However, in a situation where, if the Bank had complied with its obligation to inform the consumer of his right of cancellation,
            the consumer would have been able to avoid exposure to the risks inherent in investments such as those at issue in the main
            proceedings, Article 4 of the Directive requires Member States to ensure that their legislation protects consumers who have
            been unable to avoid exposure to such risks, by adopting suitable measures to allow them to avoid bearing the consequences
            of the materialisation of those risks.
